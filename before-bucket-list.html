    <h1>Bucket List</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>You've probably been meaning to visit certain places in the US for years - national parks, cities, landmarks, restaurants, or experiences you kept pushing to "next year." Now is the time. Once you move back to India, returning to the US as a tourist is not straightforward, and it could be years before you get the chance again.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>If you don't already have a B1/B2 (tourist) visa, getting one after you move back can be a long wait. US tourist visa appointment slots in India often have wait times of several months to over a year, and having an appointment doesn't guarantee approval.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="make-the-list">Make the list now</h2>

    <p>Sit down and write out every place or experience you've been putting off. Don't filter - just get it all out. Then prioritize based on what matters most to you and what's realistic given your timeline.</p>

    <p>Some ideas to jog your memory:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>National parks</strong> - Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Zion, Glacier, Acadia, Denali (Alaska). These are genuinely hard to experience from anywhere else in the world.</li>
      <li><strong>Cities you've never visited</strong> - New York, San Francisco, Chicago, New Orleans, Nashville, Seattle, Boston. Each has a character you won't find elsewhere.</li>
      <li><strong>Road trips</strong> - Pacific Coast Highway, Route 66, Blue Ridge Parkway. The open-road experience is uniquely American.</li>
      <li><strong>Seasonal experiences</strong> - Fall foliage in New England, cherry blossoms in DC, skiing in Colorado, beach weekends in Florida or Hawaii.</li>
      <li><strong>Food and culture</strong> - That barbecue place in Texas, the seafood shack in Maine, the jazz club in New Orleans, the museum you never got around to.</li>
      <li><strong>Events</strong> - A baseball or football game, a music festival, Mardi Gras, Fourth of July fireworks in a new city.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="practical-tips">Practical tips</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start early</strong> - Don't wait until your last month. Some trips need advance booking, and your final weeks will be consumed by packing, paperwork, and farewells.</li>
      <li><strong>Use your remaining PTO</strong> - If you're still employed and have unused vacation days, this is the best use of them. Some employers also offer a notice period where you can take time off.</li>
      <li><strong>Travel light</strong> - You're going to be shipping or selling your belongings soon. This is a good time to practice traveling with less.</li>
      <li><strong>Bring friends or family along</strong> - If your parents or family are visiting from India before the move, take them to these places too. It becomes a shared memory.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>If a big trip isn't feasible, even smaller things count - a favorite local hike, a restaurant you've always wanted to try, a day trip to a nearby town. The point is to not leave with a list of regrets about things that were an hour's drive away.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="things-youll-miss">Things you'll miss more than you expect</h2>

    <p>Beyond the bucket list destinations, there are everyday American experiences that are hard to replicate in India. Consider doing some of these one last time:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A lazy weekend at a farmer's market</li>
      <li>Hiking trails near your home</li>
      <li>Your favorite coffee shop or diner</li>
      <li>A drive through quiet suburban streets at sunset</li>
      <li>Grocery shopping at Trader Joe's or Costco</li>
      <li>A cookout or potluck with friends</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These sound small, but they're the textures of daily life that you'll remember the most. Don't wait until the last day to notice them.</p>
