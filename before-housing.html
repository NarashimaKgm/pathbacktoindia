    <h1>Housing & Lease</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>Wrapping up your housing in the US is one of those tasks that feels straightforward until you're actually doing it. Between lease terms, security deposits, utility cancellations, and figuring out what to do with your furniture — there's more to coordinate than you'd think. Start early and work through it methodically.</p>

    <h2>Breaking your lease</h2>

    <p>If your lease isn't ending naturally around your move date, you'll need to break it. Here's what to know:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Read your lease agreement carefully</strong> — Most leases have a specific early termination clause. Common penalties include 1-2 months' rent or forfeiting your security deposit. Some leases require 60 days' written notice regardless.</li>
      <li><strong>Talk to your landlord or property manager early</strong> — Be upfront about your timeline. Many landlords are more flexible than you'd expect, especially if you give enough notice and the rental market is strong. They may let you off with a reduced penalty if they can re-list quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Check if your state has early termination protections</strong> — Some states allow lease breaks for job relocation or military orders. This varies widely, so look up your state's tenant rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Subletting as an alternative</strong> — If your lease allows it, finding a subtenant can save you from paying the early termination fee. Some leases explicitly prohibit this, so check first.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Get everything in writing. If your landlord agrees to waive or reduce the early termination fee, get it documented via email or a signed letter. Verbal agreements are hard to enforce if there's a dispute later.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Security deposit</h2>

    <p>Getting your full security deposit back requires some effort, but it's worth it — deposits in high-cost cities can be thousands of dollars.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Document everything at move-out</strong> — Take photos and videos of every room, closet, appliance, and fixture on the day you leave. Compare with your move-in documentation if you have it.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean thoroughly</strong> — A deep clean (or hiring a professional cleaning service) is often the difference between getting your full deposit back and losing a chunk of it to "cleaning fees."</li>
      <li><strong>Fix minor damage</strong> — Patch small nail holes, touch up scuff marks, replace burnt-out bulbs. These minor repairs are cheap to do yourself but expensive when charged by a landlord.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide a forwarding address</strong> — Your landlord needs somewhere to send the deposit check. If you don't have a US address, give a trusted friend or family member's address. Some landlords will do direct deposit if you ask.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>Most states have laws requiring landlords to return your deposit within 14-30 days of move-out. If they're deducting for damages, they usually must provide an itemized list. Know your state's rules — it gives you leverage if there's a dispute.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Furniture and belongings</h2>

    <p>You can't take everything. Decide early what you're shipping, selling, donating, or trashing.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ship only what's worth it</strong> — Shipping costs add up fast. As a rule of thumb, if you can buy it cheaper in India than it costs to ship, don't ship it. Electronics, sentimental items, and specialty items are usually worth shipping. Furniture usually isn't.</li>
      <li><strong>Sell on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or OfferUp</strong> — Start listing things 3-4 weeks before your move-out date. Price to sell — you're optimizing for speed, not maximum value. Furniture, kitchen appliances, and workout equipment sell well.</li>
      <li><strong>Donate what you can't sell</strong> — Goodwill, Salvation Army, and local Buy Nothing groups are great options. Many organizations will even pick up large items. Keep donation receipts for tax deductions.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't leave stuff behind</strong> — Anything left in the apartment after move-out may be charged against your security deposit as "junk removal." Clear everything out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Utilities and services to cancel</h2>

    <p>Go through this list in the last 1-2 weeks before your move-out date:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Electricity and gas</strong> — Schedule a shutoff date with your provider. Request a final bill to be sent to your forwarding address or email.</li>
      <li><strong>Internet and cable</strong> — Cancel and return any rented equipment (routers, cable boxes). Missing equipment means fees. Some providers let you drop off at a UPS store.</li>
      <li><strong>Water and trash</strong> — Often bundled with rent, but if you pay separately, cancel these too.</li>
      <li><strong>Renter's insurance</strong> — Cancel your policy. If you've prepaid, you may be entitled to a prorated refund.</li>
      <li><strong>Car insurance</strong> — Cancel after you've sold or shipped your car. Get confirmation in writing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mail forwarding</h2>

    <p>You'll continue to receive US mail for months — tax documents, bank statements, government correspondence, stray packages.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>USPS mail forwarding</strong> — Set up forwarding to a trusted US address (family or friend). USPS forwards most first-class mail for up to 12 months. Do this at usps.com — it costs about $1 for identity verification.</li>
      <li><strong>Update your address directly</strong> — Don't rely solely on USPS forwarding. Update your address with your bank, credit card companies, IRS, state tax agency, DMV, insurance, and any subscription services.</li>
      <li><strong>Virtual mailbox services</strong> — Services like Traveling Mailbox or Earth Class Mail give you a US address, scan your mail, and let you view it online. Useful if you don't have someone in the US to handle your mail. Costs around $15-30/month.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Switch every possible account to paperless/email delivery before you leave. The less physical mail you're expecting, the fewer things can get lost in transit.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>If you own your car</h2>

    <p>Selling a car takes longer than you think — start 4-6 weeks before your move.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Private sale</strong> — Gets you the best price but takes more effort. List on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and AutoTrader. Have your title ready.</li>
      <li><strong>CarMax or Carvana</strong> — Quick and hassle-free. You get an offer (valid for 7 days), drive in, and leave with a check. You'll get less than private sale, but the convenience is worth it if time is tight.</li>
      <li><strong>Dealer trade-in</strong> — Only makes sense if you're buying another car, which you're probably not.</li>
      <li><strong>Cancel registration and plates</strong> — After selling, notify your state's DMV. Some states require you to return plates. Failing to do this can result in toll charges or tickets hitting your record.</li>
    </ul>
