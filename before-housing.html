    <h1>Housing & Lease</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>This page covers the case of living in a rental apartment. Guidance for homeowners (selling property, handling mortgages, etc.) will be added later.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Wrapping up your housing in the US is one of those tasks that feels straightforward until you're actually doing it. Between lease terms, security deposits, utility cancellations, and figuring out what to do with your furniture — there's more to coordinate than you'd think. Start early and work through it methodically.</p>

    <h2 id="breaking-lease">Breaking your lease</h2>

    <p>If your lease isn't ending naturally around your move date, you'll need to break it. Here's what to know:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Read your lease agreement carefully</strong> — Most leases have a specific early termination clause. Common penalties include 1-2 months' rent or forfeiting your security deposit. Some leases require 60 days' written notice regardless.</li>
      <li><strong>Talk to your landlord or property manager early</strong> — Be upfront about your timeline. Many landlords are more flexible than you'd expect, especially if you give enough notice and the rental market is strong. They may let you off with a reduced penalty if they can re-list quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Check if your state has early termination protections</strong> — Some states allow lease breaks for job relocation or military orders. This varies widely, so look up your state's tenant rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Check renter protections at the state and county level</strong> — Beyond state laws, your county may offer additional renter protections — early termination rights, relocation allowances, or required notice periods. County-level rules are often overlooked but can be more favorable than state law.</li>
      <li><strong>Subletting as an alternative</strong> — Even if your lease doesn't specifically mention subletting, it's worth asking your landlord. Many are open to it once they understand you're relocating internationally — they'd rather have a paying subtenant than deal with a vacancy or early termination. If your lease does allow it, finding a subtenant can save you from the early termination fee entirely.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Get everything in writing. If your landlord agrees to waive or reduce the early termination fee, get it documented via email or a signed letter. Verbal agreements are hard to enforce if there's a dispute later.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="security-deposit">Security deposit</h2>

    <p>Getting your full security deposit back requires some effort, but it's worth it — deposits in high-cost cities can be thousands of dollars.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Document everything at move-out</strong> — Take photos and videos of every room, closet, appliance, and fixture on the day you leave. Compare with your move-in documentation if you have it.</li>
      <li><strong>Request a move-out inspection</strong> — Many apartments offer a pre-move-out walkthrough. Take it. This tells you exactly what they'll flag so you can fix things before the final inspection. Ask specifically what their cleaning standards are — most complexes will charge a base cleaning fee regardless (their standard is typically higher than normal household cleaning and this charge is often unavoidable), but you can avoid the much larger "deep cleaning" surcharges by returning the place in a reasonable state. Focus on kitchens, bathrooms, and appliances — these are where the big charges come from.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean thoroughly</strong> — You probably can't avoid the standard cleaning fee, but you can avoid deep cleaning charges. Scrub the oven, stovetop, fridge interior, bathroom tiles, and baseboards. Remove any stains from countertops and sinks. The goal isn't perfection — it's making sure nothing gets flagged as requiring extra work beyond their routine turnover clean.</li>
      <li><strong>Know the expected lifespan of flooring, paint, and carpet</strong> — Check your lease or your state's landlord-tenant guidelines for the useful life of items like carpet, paint, and flooring. If the carpet's expected life is 7 years and you've lived there for 5, you should only be charged for the remaining 2 years of value — not a full replacement. Charges for normal wear and tear should be pro-rated based on how long you've been a tenant. This applies to paint, blinds, appliances, and other fixtures too. Push back if they try to charge you full replacement cost for something that was already near end of life when you moved in.</li>
      <li><strong>Fix minor damage</strong> — Patch small nail holes, touch up scuff marks, replace burnt-out bulbs. These minor repairs are cheap to do yourself but expensive when charged by a landlord.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide a forwarding address</strong> — Your landlord needs somewhere to send the deposit check. If you don't have a US address, give a trusted friend or family member's address. Some landlords will do direct deposit if you ask.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>Most states have laws requiring landlords to return your deposit within 14-30 days of move-out. If they're deducting for damages, they usually must provide an itemized list. Know your state's rules — it gives you leverage if there's a dispute.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Resolve disputes before you leave the country</p>
      <p>Try to settle all deposit and dues disputes with your leasing company while you're still in the US. Fighting charges from India — across time zones, without the ability to show up in person — is significantly harder. One way to give yourself this buffer: move out of your apartment early, crash at a friend's place or book an Airbnb or hotel for your final days, and use that overlap to handle the move-out inspection, dispute any deductions, and get your deposit situation fully resolved before your flight.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="furniture">Furniture and belongings</h2>

    <p>You can't take everything. Decide early what you're shipping, selling, donating, or trashing.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ship only what's worth it</strong> — Shipping costs add up fast. As a rule of thumb, if you can buy it cheaper in India than it costs to ship, don't ship it. Electronics, sentimental items, and specialty items are usually worth shipping. Furniture usually isn't.</li>
      <li><strong>Sell on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or OfferUp</strong> — Start listing things 3-4 weeks before your move-out date. Price to sell — you're optimizing for speed, not maximum value. Furniture, kitchen appliances, and workout equipment sell well.</li>
      <li><strong>Donate what you can't sell</strong> — Goodwill, Salvation Army, and local Buy Nothing groups are great options. Many organizations will even pick up large items. Keep donation receipts for tax deductions.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't leave stuff behind</strong> — Anything left in the apartment after move-out may be charged against your security deposit as "junk removal." Clear everything out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="utilities">Utilities and services to cancel</h2>

    <p>Go through this list in the last 1-2 weeks before your move-out date:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Electricity and gas</strong> — Schedule a shutoff date with your provider. Request a final bill to be sent to your forwarding address or email.</li>
      <li><strong>Internet and cable</strong> — Cancel and return any rented equipment (routers, cable boxes). Missing equipment means fees. Some providers let you drop off at a UPS store.</li>
      <li><strong>Water and trash</strong> — Often bundled with rent, but if you pay separately, cancel these too.</li>
      <li><strong>Renter's insurance</strong> — Cancel your policy. If you've prepaid, you may be entitled to a prorated refund.</li>
      <li><strong>Gym memberships</strong> — Cancel in person or in writing — many gyms don't accept cancellations over the phone. Check your contract for cancellation notice periods or early termination fees. Some require 30 days' notice, so don't wait until the last week.</li>
      <li><strong>Library accounts</strong> — Return all borrowed books, DVDs, and other materials. Close or settle your account to avoid fines that can pile up while you're overseas. If you have any holds or pending requests, cancel them.</li>
      <li><strong>Store credits and loyalty points</strong> — Use up any remaining store credits, gift cards, and loyalty points before you leave. Check balances on places you frequent — grocery stores, coffee shops, retail memberships. These are nearly impossible to use from India and many expire after a period of inactivity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="mail-forwarding">Mail forwarding</h2>

    <p>You'll continue to receive US mail for months — tax documents, bank statements, government correspondence, stray packages.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>USPS mail forwarding</strong> — Set up forwarding to a trusted US address (family or friend) at usps.com. The standard forwarding period is 12 months and covers most mail types — first-class, Priority, periodicals, and more. After the standard period ends, USPS offers an extended forwarding option for an additional 6-18 months (paid). Worth considering if you expect tax documents or government correspondence to trickle in beyond the first year.</li>
      <li><strong>Update your address directly</strong> — Don't rely solely on USPS forwarding. Update your address with your bank, credit card companies, IRS, state tax agency, DMV, insurance, and any subscription services.</li>
      <li><strong>Virtual mailbox services</strong> — Services like Traveling Mailbox or Earth Class Mail give you a US address, scan your mail, and let you view it online. Useful if you don't have someone in the US to handle your mail. Costs around $15-30/month.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Switch every possible account to paperless/email delivery before you leave. The less physical mail you're expecting, the fewer things can get lost in transit.</p>
