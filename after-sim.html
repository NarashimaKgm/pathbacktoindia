    <h1>Get Indian SIM Card</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>An Indian mobile number is essential — you need it for UPI payments, bank account verification, Aadhaar OTPs, food delivery, ride-hailing, and practically every digital service in India. Getting a SIM should be one of the first things you do after landing.</p>

    <h2>Choosing a carrier</h2>

    <p>India currently has three major carriers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Jio (Reliance)</strong> — Strongest 4G/5G coverage nationwide, competitive data plans, good in both urban and rural areas. The most popular network in India.</li>
      <li><strong>Airtel</strong> — Reliable network quality, especially in urban areas. Generally considered to have slightly better call quality and customer service. Slightly more expensive plans.</li>
      <li><strong>Vi (Vodafone Idea)</strong> — Decent coverage in metros and major cities. Network quality has been inconsistent in some regions. Usually the cheapest plans.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Ask family or neighbors which network works best in your specific area. Coverage can vary significantly even within the same city. If you're unsure, Jio or Airtel are safe defaults for most locations.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>KYC and documents</h2>

    <p>Getting a SIM requires completing KYC (Know Your Customer) verification:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aadhaar-based eKYC</strong> — The fastest method. Visit a carrier store, provide your Aadhaar number, verify with a fingerprint or OTP, and the SIM is activated within hours. This is the standard process now.</li>
      <li><strong>Without Aadhaar</strong> — You can use your passport and a proof of address. Activation may take 1-2 days longer as the verification is done manually. Some stores may be reluctant — try the carrier's own branded store rather than a small reseller.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>If you just landed and don't have Aadhaar yet, use your Indian passport for KYC. The SIM will be activated with a temporary address verification. Once you get Aadhaar, you can update the KYC later.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Prepaid vs postpaid</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prepaid</strong> — Pay upfront for a recharge plan. Easier to get (no credit check), flexible, and you can switch plans anytime. Most Indians use prepaid. Plans range from ₹199–₹999 for 28–84 days with unlimited calls and data.</li>
      <li><strong>Postpaid</strong> — Monthly bill with a fixed plan. Requires identity verification and sometimes a credit check. Benefits include higher data limits, no service interruption if you forget to recharge, and international roaming options. Useful if you plan to travel frequently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Porting an existing Indian number</h2>

    <p>If you have an old Indian number that's still active (perhaps on a family member's plan or a number you kept alive from before):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You can port it to a new carrier by sending an SMS: <strong>PORT &lt;your 10-digit number&gt;</strong> to <strong>1900</strong>.</li>
      <li>You'll receive a Unique Porting Code (UPC) valid for 4 days.</li>
      <li>Visit the new carrier's store with the UPC, complete KYC, and the port happens within 3-7 working days.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>eSIM</h2>

    <p>If your phone supports eSIM, both Jio and Airtel offer eSIM activation. This is convenient if you want to keep your US SIM in the physical slot and use the Indian number on eSIM (or vice versa). Activation is done at the carrier store — you'll scan a QR code to download the eSIM profile.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Keep your US number and Indian number on the same phone using physical SIM + eSIM (or dual eSIM if your phone supports it). This way you can still receive US 2FA codes and calls while using your Indian number for daily life.</p>
