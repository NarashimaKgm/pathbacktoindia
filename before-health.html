    <h1>Health Insurance</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>Health insurance is one of the easiest things to underestimate during relocation planning. A short uninsured gap can become expensive fast if an emergency happens before your move to India. Plan this timeline before you choose your final working day.</p>

    <h2 id="when-coverage-ends">When employer coverage ends</h2>

    <p>There is no universal rule that every plan follows. In many companies, coverage ends either on your last day of employment or at month-end of your last working month. The exact date depends on your employer's health plan document and HR policy.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ask HR for the exact termination date in writing</strong> for medical, dental, and vision coverage.</li>
      <li><strong>Confirm dependent coverage timing</strong> so family members are not left uninsured.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask when your COBRA election packet will be sent</strong> and where it will be mailed or emailed.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Do not assume coverage continues to month-end. Confirm your actual plan rule before setting your resignation date or flight date.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="cobra">COBRA after resignation or layoff</h2>

    <p>If your employer-sponsored coverage ends because of resignation or layoff, COBRA usually lets you continue the same group health plan for a limited period.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>COBRA generally applies to private-sector and state/local government employers with 20 or more employees.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>You typically get 60 days to elect COBRA</strong> from the later of the date coverage is lost or the date the election notice is provided.</li>
      <li><strong>After you elect COBRA, you have 45 days to make the first premium payment.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Initial COBRA premiums can be high</strong> because you usually pay the full premium plus up to a 2% administrative fee.</li>
      <li><strong>Coverage is generally retroactive to the date your employer coverage ended</strong> if you elect and pay within timelines.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>If cash flow is tight, remember the COBRA 45-day initial payment window. You can still preserve uninterrupted coverage as long as you elect and pay on time.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="layoff-severance">Layoff severance and employer-paid coverage</h2>

    <p>When layoffs happen, some employers subsidize COBRA premiums for a few months as part of severance. This is common, but not legally required under federal COBRA rules.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Read your severance agreement carefully</strong> for exact duration and what is paid (medical only vs medical+dental+vision).</li>
      <li><strong>Confirm whether subsidy ends immediately if you get a new job</strong> with benefits.</li>
      <li><strong>Track subsidy end date now</strong> so you do not miss your next coverage transition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives to COBRA</h2>

    <p>COBRA is not your only option. Losing job-based coverage also qualifies you for a Special Enrollment Period in the Health Insurance Marketplace.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Marketplace SEP:</strong> generally available from 60 days before to 60 days after loss of qualifying coverage.</li>
      <li><strong>Spouse's employer plan:</strong> loss of your own coverage is usually a qualifying life event for mid-year enrollment.</li>
      <li><strong>Medicaid/CHIP:</strong> if household eligibility changes after job loss, this may be available.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>If your move to India date is close, compare total cost vs convenience. Sometimes COBRA for a short bridge period is simpler even if monthly cost is higher.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="checklist">Practical checklist before your last day</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Ask HR for your exact benefits termination date.</li>
      <li>Get COBRA administrator contact details and expected notice date.</li>
      <li>Estimate COBRA premium and decide your backup option (Marketplace/spouse plan).</li>
      <li>Refill essential prescriptions and schedule pending appointments while still covered.</li>
      <li>Keep digital copies of insurance cards, claims, and EOBs before access changes.</li>
      <li>Do not leave any uninsured gap between resignation and travel to India.</li>
    </ol>
