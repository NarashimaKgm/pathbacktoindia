    <h1>Finances & Banking</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>Getting your finances sorted before you leave is one of the most important - and most stressful - parts of the move. You're essentially unwinding years of financial setup in the US while simultaneously preparing for a new financial life in India. The decisions you make now - what to do with your 401(k), how to move money, which accounts to keep open - will have lasting tax implications in both countries. This page is meant to give you enough context to ask the right questions, not to replace professional advice.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Talk to tax professionals before making financial decisions</p>
      <p>Before you close accounts, roll over retirement funds, or transfer large sums - schedule consultation calls with two types of tax professionals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A US-based tax consultant</strong> with experience filing and managing non-resident returns, especially for people who have moved to India. They'll help you understand your ongoing US filing obligations, FBAR requirements, and how to handle retirement accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>An India-based tax consultant</strong> with a track record of filing returns and managing international assets for people who have moved back from the US. They'll help you navigate residency rules, DTAA benefits, and how your US assets are taxed in India.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These need to be two separate professionals - a consultant who is excellent at Indian resident tax filings will almost certainly not have the expertise for US non-resident returns, and vice versa. Don't assume your usual tax person can handle both sides just because they're well-known or highly recommended in their area. Look specifically for a track record with cross-border cases involving the US and India.</p>
      <p>The information on this page is a starting point to help you have meaningful conversations with those professionals. Every situation is different - your visa status, assets, income sources, and timeline all affect what the right moves are for you. Do your own due diligence and work with qualified professionals before making decisions.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="bank-accounts">Bank accounts - what to close, what to keep</h2>

    <p>Your first instinct might be to close everything. Don't. There are good reasons to keep at least one US bank account open. But before you decide which accounts to keep, you need to understand how your residency change affects them.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Non-resident account rules matter</p>
      <p>Once you move to India and become a non-resident of the US, any US bank accounts you keep open should technically be converted to non-resident accounts. Non-resident accounts have different tax treatment - interest earned is subject to US withholding tax, and reporting requirements change. Some banks allow existing customers to convert their resident accounts to non-resident status by updating the address to an Indian address after you move. Others strictly do not offer non-resident accounts and will require you to close them before you leave. Factor this into your decision about which bank and which accounts to keep - check your bank's non-resident policy before assuming you can hold on to a particular account or credit card.</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep one checking account open</strong> - You'll need it for stray deposits (tax refunds, security deposit returns, final paychecks), recurring subscriptions you haven't cancelled yet, and as a landing pad for any US-based income. Before choosing which bank to keep, confirm they allow non-resident account holders and understand what changes when you update your status.</li>
      <li><strong>Close everything else</strong> - Savings accounts, store cards, and any accounts you don't actively need. Simplify. Each open account is one more thing to monitor from 10,000 miles away.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>File Form W-8BEN with every US financial institution</h3>

    <p>Once you become a non-resident, you need to file <strong>Form W-8BEN</strong> (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner) with each US bank, brokerage, or financial institution where you hold an account. This form tells the institution that you're a non-resident alien and allows them to apply the reduced withholding tax rate under the US-India DTAA (Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement) instead of the default rate.</p>

    <p>Per IRS regulations, non-resident aliens are subject to <strong>30% withholding</strong> on the following types of US-sourced income:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Dividends</li>
      <li>Interest (including portfolio interest)</li>
      <li>Royalties</li>
      <li>Short-term capital gain distributions from mutual funds</li>
      <li>Long-term capital gain distributions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With a valid W-8BEN on file, your institution can apply the reduced treaty rate under the US-India DTAA instead of the default 30%. The exact reduced rate depends on the type of income.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>File it with every institution</strong> - Each bank and brokerage needs its own W-8BEN. Filing it with one institution doesn't cover another. If you have a checking account at one bank and a brokerage account elsewhere, both need a W-8BEN.</li>
      <li><strong>It expires</strong> - The W-8BEN is valid for three years from the date of signing. You'll need to re-file it before it expires, or the institution will revert to the default 30% withholding. Set a reminder.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Without W-8BEN, it gets worse - backup withholding on gross proceeds</p>
      <p>Beyond the 30% withholding on income, if you don't have a valid W-8BEN on file, your brokerage is also required to apply <strong>24% backup withholding on gross proceeds</strong> from transactions like stock sales, mutual fund redemptions, and tender offers. This is withheld on the <strong>entire sale amount</strong> - not just your profit. So if you sell $100,000 worth of stock, they withhold $24,000 regardless of whether you made a gain or a loss. Getting that money back requires filing a US tax return and claiming a refund, which is a slow and painful process from India. File your W-8BEN before you sell anything.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="credit-cards">Credit cards</h2>

    <p>A US credit history takes years to build and disappears fast. It's worth keeping at least one credit card active, especially if you think you might return to the US someday. But there are a few things to think through.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep a no-annual-fee card open</strong> - Make a small charge on it every few months to keep it active. A dormant card may get closed by the issuer, which hurts your credit score. Set up autopay so you don't miss a payment from India.</li>
      <li><strong>Check the issuer's non-resident policy</strong> - Not all credit card issuers will let you keep the card once your address changes to an international one. Some will close the account or restrict features. Verify this before deciding which card to keep.</li>
      <li><strong>Redeem or use your rewards before closing cards</strong> - Points, miles, and cashback balances often expire or get forfeited when you close an account. Transfer or redeem them before you cancel.</li>
      <li><strong>Pay off all balances in full</strong> - Don't leave the US with credit card debt if you can avoid it. Managing disputes or late fees from India is a headache you don't need.</li>
      <li><strong>Close store cards and cards with annual fees you can't use</strong> - Store cards (Target, Amazon Store Card, etc.) are rarely worth keeping. For premium cards with annual fees, check when your next fee cycle renews. If you're still getting value from the perks in India - lounge access, travel insurance, purchase protection, hotel status - hold on to the card until the end of the current fee cycle and cancel after you've moved back. No point paying for a year of perks you won't use, but also no point canceling early if you've already paid for them.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask about India-specific product changes</strong> - A few issuers (e.g., Amex) have India variants and may let you switch your US card to an Indian product. This preserves your account history and gets you a card that works locally. If you're closing a card with an annual fee, ask the issuer about a product change to a no-fee variant instead - it keeps the credit line open without the cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Confirm mailing address requirements</strong> - Some issuers accept a non-US billing address but will not ship replacement cards or statements outside the US. You may need a US mailing address (friend, family, or virtual mailbox) for card deliveries. Confirm this with each provider before you move.</li>
      <li><strong>Understand forex and foreign transaction fees</strong> - If you plan to use your US credit card for purchases in India, check the foreign transaction fee - typically 1-3% on top of the exchange rate. Some cards (Chase Sapphire, Capital One) waive this fee. Factor this in when deciding which cards to keep.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't rely on travel rewards for India hotel bookings</strong> - While you can book hotels through credit card travel portals, paying directly at hotels in India or through Indian booking sites (MakeMyTrip, Goibibo) is often significantly cheaper. Double-check the cost difference before holding on to a travel rewards card solely for that purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">No CIBIL score?</p>
      <p>If you don't have a CIBIL credit score in India and lack Indian income proof, it might be difficult to get most Indian credit cards. Banks will only offer starter or secured cards with low limits until you build a local credit history.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="moving-money">Moving money to India</h2>

    <p>You'll likely need to transfer a significant amount. Here are your main options:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wire transfer (bank to bank)</strong> - The most straightforward option for large amounts. Your US bank sends directly to your Indian bank account (NRE or NRO). Fees range from $15-45 per transfer, and exchange rates from banks are usually not the best.</li>
      <li><strong>Wise (formerly TransferWise)</strong> - Generally offers better exchange rates and lower fees than banks, especially for amounts under $50,000. Transfers typically arrive in 1-2 business days.</li>
      <li><strong>Remitly, Xe, OFX</strong> - Other services worth comparing. Rates and fees vary, so check on the day you're transferring.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Large transfers may trigger compliance checks on both ends - your US bank may put a hold and your Indian bank may ask for documentation (offer letter, passport, etc.). Don't leave all your money transfers to the last week. Spread them out over time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>Before transferring assets to India, understand the differences between NRE, NRO, and FCNR accounts - each has different rules on repatriation, tax treatment of interest, and the type of funds they accept. Choosing the wrong account type can have tax consequences and limit your ability to move money back out later.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="retirement">401(k) and retirement accounts</h2>

    <p>This is where many people get stuck. There is no single right answer - you have to make a final call yourself based on your current situation and anticipated future plans. To make that call, you need to understand what you're working with.</p>

    <h3>Understanding your account types</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pre-tax 401(k) / Traditional 401(k)</strong> - Contributions were made before tax. The money grows tax-deferred in the US. You pay US income tax when you withdraw. If you withdraw before age 59 1/2, you also pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty on top of the income tax.</li>
      <li><strong>Roth 401(k)</strong> - Contributions were made after tax. In the US, qualified withdrawals (after age 59 1/2 and 5-year holding) are completely tax-free - both the contributions and the growth. But India does not recognize this tax-free status (more on that below).</li>
      <li><strong>Traditional / Rollover IRA</strong> - A Traditional IRA holds funds rolled over from a pre-tax 401(k) or direct contributions. Same tax treatment as a pre-tax 401(k) - tax-deferred growth, taxed as income on withdrawal, 10% penalty if before 59 1/2.</li>
      <li><strong>Roth IRA</strong> - After-tax contributions with tax-free qualified withdrawals in the US. You can always withdraw your original contributions (not earnings) penalty-free. Earnings are tax-free after age 59 1/2 and 5-year holding. Again, India does not honor this tax-free treatment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What to do with them</h3>

    <p>You generally have three choices:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Leave it where it is</strong> - You can leave your 401(k) with your former employer's plan (if the balance is above their minimum, usually $5,000). The money continues to grow tax-deferred in the US. This is often the simplest option but gives you limited investment choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Roll it into an IRA</strong> - Move your pre-tax 401(k) to a Traditional/Rollover IRA and your Roth 401(k) to a Roth IRA at a brokerage like Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. Gives you more investment choices and consolidates your accounts. Most brokerages will keep your account open with a foreign address, but some have restrictions - check before you move.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash it out</strong> - Withdraw the full amount. For pre-tax accounts, you'll pay income tax plus a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're under 59 1/2. For Roth accounts, you can withdraw contributions penalty-free, but earnings withdrawn early are penalized. The IRS also withholds 30% on distributions to non-residents (reduced to lower rates under the US-India DTAA). Cashing out rarely makes financial sense unless you need the money urgently.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>If you're rolling over to an IRA, do it before you leave the US. Some brokerages make it harder to open new accounts with a foreign address. Fidelity and Schwab are generally more friendly to non-resident account holders.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Conversions and operations as a non-resident</h3>

    <p>As a non-resident of the US, some account operations are still available to you:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>401(k) to IRA rollover</strong> - You can roll over a former employer's 401(k) to an IRA even after leaving the US. This is a direct transfer, not a taxable event (as long as pre-tax goes to Traditional IRA and Roth goes to Roth IRA).</li>
      <li><strong>Roth conversion (Traditional IRA -&gt; Roth IRA)</strong> - You can convert pre-tax funds to Roth. The IRS treats this as a taxable distribution - the converted amount is subject to 30% NRA withholding. The US-India DTAA may reduce withholding on periodic pension distributions, but a Roth conversion is a lump-sum event and unlikely to qualify for treaty relief. Whether this makes sense depends on your current tax situation, expected future rates, and India's treatment of these accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>New contributions</strong> - You generally cannot contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA without US earned income. Once you leave the US and no longer have US-sourced earned income, contributions stop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How India taxes these accounts</h3>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>India does not recognize the tax-sheltered status of US retirement accounts. Once you become a tax resident of India, the income earned inside these accounts - dividends, interest, and capital gains - is taxable in India on an accrual basis every year, regardless of whether the accounts are tax-deferred or tax-free in the US.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This means:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)</strong> - Even though withdrawals are tax-free in the US, India treats these as regular investment accounts. Dividends are taxable as "income from other sources" in the year they are received. Capital gains are taxed based on holding period - short-term at slab rates, long-term at applicable rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Pre-tax 401(k) and Traditional IRA</strong> - India would ordinarily tax the accrued income (dividends, capital gains) each year. However, Section 89A of the Indian Income Tax Act provides relief (see below).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Section 89A and Form 10-EE - deferring India tax on pre-tax accounts</h3>

    <p>Section 89A was introduced to address the double-taxation problem for residents returning to India with foreign retirement accounts. It allows you to defer India tax on income from specified foreign retirement accounts (including US 401(k) and Traditional IRA) until one of these events:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You withdraw the funds from the retirement account, or</li>
      <li>You change your residency status back to non-resident in India</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To elect this deferral, you must file <strong>Form 10-EE</strong> electronically on or before the due date of your Indian income tax return. Once you exercise this option, it applies to all subsequent years and cannot be withdrawn.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>Section 89A relief is available only for pre-tax retirement accounts (Traditional 401(k), Traditional/Rollover IRA). It does not cover Roth accounts since those are not classified as tax-deferred in the US. For Roth accounts, you will need to track and report dividends and capital gains to Indian tax authorities every year.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Given the complexity of India's treatment of these accounts, this is one of the most important topics to discuss with your cross-border tax professionals. The decision to leave funds in the US, convert between account types, or withdraw depends heavily on your specific tax situation in both countries.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="tax-implications">Tax implications</h2>

    <p>Moving between countries creates a complicated tax year. Some things to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>You'll file US taxes for the year you leave</strong> - This is a partial-year return covering your US income. You may also need to file a state return depending on your state's rules.</li>
      <li><strong>US citizens and green card holders must file US taxes forever</strong> - Even from India. If you're on H1-B and not a citizen/permanent resident, your US filing obligation generally ends when you leave.</li>
      <li><strong>FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Report)</strong> - If you keep US accounts and the combined balance exceeds $10,000 at any point during the year, you must file an FBAR. This applies even after you move to India if you still have US accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>India taxes based on residency</strong> - Once you're a resident, your worldwide income is taxable in India. The US-India tax treaty helps avoid double taxation, but it's complicated.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>The year you move is the most complex for taxes. Strongly consider hiring a cross-border tax professional who understands both US and Indian tax systems. The cost is worth avoiding mistakes that can be expensive to fix later.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="estate-tax">US estate tax for non-residents</h2>

    <p>This is something most people don't think about until it's too late. Once you become a non-resident of the US, the US estate tax rules change significantly - and not in your favor.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Much lower exemption threshold</strong> - US residents and citizens get a federal estate tax exemption of over $13 million. Non-resident aliens get only $60,000. That means if you hold more than $60,000 in US-situated assets at the time of death, your estate could owe federal estate tax on the excess - at rates up to 40%.</li>
      <li><strong>What counts as US-situated assets</strong> - This includes cash in US bank accounts, equities held in US brokerage accounts (US-listed stocks, ETFs, mutual funds), US real estate, and tangible personal property located in the US. Essentially, if the asset is "in" the US, it's potentially subject to estate tax.</li>
      <li><strong>US-listed stocks and ETFs in brokerage accounts</strong> - Even if you hold them through a US brokerage like Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard, US-listed equities are considered US-situated property. This is a major consideration if you plan to keep a US brokerage account with a significant portfolio after your move.</li>
      <li><strong>Bank deposits may have an exception</strong> - Deposits in US bank accounts (checking, savings, CDs) that are not effectively connected with a US trade or business are generally exempt from estate tax for non-residents. This is one reason keeping a US bank account is less risky than keeping a large US brokerage account.</li>
      <li><strong>The US-India tax treaty may help</strong> - The DTAA between the US and India has provisions related to estate and inheritance tax, but the specifics are complex and depend on your individual situation. This is exactly the kind of question to bring to your tax professionals.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">This affects how much you keep in US accounts</p>
      <p>The $60,000 non-resident exemption is surprisingly low. If you're planning to keep a US brokerage account with significant holdings, or maintain large balances in US accounts, factor estate tax exposure into your decision. This isn't just about your tax bill while you're alive - it's about what your family would face if something happened to you.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Managing estate tax exposure</h3>

    <p>If your US-situated assets are well above $60,000, there are a few strategies to consider:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Get life insurance to cover the estimated estate tax</strong> - A policy that pays out an amount equivalent to the estimated estate tax liability can ensure your family isn't stuck with a large tax bill. The insurance payout itself is generally not subject to US estate tax if structured properly (e.g., held in an irrevocable trust).</li>
      <li><strong>Move out of US-domiciled funds and equities entirely</strong> - Liquidate your US brokerage holdings and reinvest through Indian or international platforms. Once the assets are no longer US-situated, they fall outside the US estate tax net. This is the most straightforward approach but triggers capital gains tax on the sale, so the timing matters.</li>
      <li><strong>Invest through funds domiciled in a third country</strong> - If you still want exposure to US equities, consider funds domiciled in countries with favorable estate tax treatment (e.g., Ireland-domiciled ETFs that track US indices like the S&amp;P 500). These are not considered US-situated assets. However, these funds are typically not available in US brokerage accounts - you would need to liquidate your US holdings and reinvest through an international brokerage that offers them.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>If you qualify for RNOR (Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident) status in India - which typically applies for the first 2-3 years after your return - your foreign income and capital gains are not taxable in India. This window can be a good time to liquidate US holdings and move assets to India with minimal Indian tax impact, reducing your US estate tax exposure before RNOR expires and your worldwide income becomes taxable.</p>

      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>This is an important topic to discuss with your tax professional before you make up your mind. Each approach has trade-offs - capital gains tax on liquidation, insurance premiums, fund expense ratios, and currency considerations. A professional can help you model the numbers for your specific situation.</p>

    <h2 id="loose-ends">Other financial loose ends</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>HSA (Health Savings Account)</strong> - If you have one, you can keep it and use it for qualified medical expenses. The funds don't expire. You just can't contribute after losing your US health insurance.</li>
      <li><strong>Stock options / RSUs</strong> - Check your vesting schedule. Unvested RSUs are typically forfeited when you leave. Vested but unexercised stock options may have a limited exercise window (often 90 days) after your last day.</li>
      <li><strong>Student loans</strong> - These don't go away when you move. Set up autopay from your US account and budget for them in your India finances.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscriptions and recurring charges</strong> - Go through your credit card statements and cancel anything you won't use. Gym memberships, streaming services with US-only content, insurance policies - they add up.</li>
    </ul>
