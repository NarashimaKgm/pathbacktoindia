    <h1>Finances & Banking</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>Getting your finances sorted before you leave is one of the most important — and most stressful — parts of the move. You're essentially unwinding years of financial setup in the US while simultaneously preparing for a new financial life in India. Start early, because most of this takes longer than you expect.</p>

    <h2>Bank accounts — what to close, what to keep</h2>

    <p>Your first instinct might be to close everything. Don't. There are good reasons to keep at least one US bank account open.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep one checking account open</strong> — You'll need it for stray deposits (tax refunds, security deposit returns, final paychecks), recurring subscriptions you haven't cancelled yet, and as a landing pad for any US-based income. Chase, Bank of America, and similar large banks work fine for this.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep one credit card active</strong> — A US credit history takes years to build and disappears fast. Keep a no-annual-fee card open and make a small charge occasionally. This is especially important if you think you might return to the US someday.</li>
      <li><strong>Close everything else</strong> — Savings accounts, additional credit cards, store cards. Simplify. Each open account is one more thing to monitor from 10,000 miles away.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Update the address on the accounts you're keeping to a trusted US address (family or friend). Some banks restrict features or close accounts with international addresses.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Moving money to India</h2>

    <p>You'll likely need to transfer a significant amount. Here are your main options:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wire transfer (bank to bank)</strong> — The most straightforward option for large amounts. Your US bank sends directly to your Indian bank account (NRE or NRO). Fees range from $15-45 per transfer, and exchange rates from banks are usually not the best.</li>
      <li><strong>Wise (formerly TransferWise)</strong> — Generally offers better exchange rates and lower fees than banks, especially for amounts under $50,000. Transfers typically arrive in 1-2 business days.</li>
      <li><strong>Remitly, Xe, OFX</strong> — Other services worth comparing. Rates and fees vary, so check on the day you're transferring.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Large transfers may trigger compliance checks on both ends — your US bank may put a hold and your Indian bank may ask for documentation (offer letter, passport, etc.). Don't leave all your money transfers to the last week. Spread them out over time.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>NRE vs NRO accounts</h3>

    <p>Before transferring money, you need to understand where it's going in India:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>NRE (Non-Resident External)</strong> — For money earned outside India. Fully repatriable (you can send it back to the US if needed). Interest earned is tax-free in India. This is where your wire transfers from the US should land.</li>
      <li><strong>NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary)</strong> — For income earned in India (rent, dividends, etc.). Repatriation is limited (up to $1M per financial year with some paperwork). Interest is taxable in India.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>Once you become a resident Indian (for tax purposes), your NRE account will need to be converted to a regular resident savings account. The NRO can be converted too. Talk to your Indian bank about the timeline — the rules around when exactly you become "resident" can be nuanced.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>401(k) and retirement accounts</h2>

    <p>This is where many people get stuck. You have a few options, and none of them are perfect:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Leave it where it is</strong> — You can leave your 401(k) with your former employer's plan (if the balance is above their minimum, usually $5,000). The money continues to grow tax-deferred. This is often the simplest option.</li>
      <li><strong>Roll it into an IRA</strong> — Move it to a Traditional IRA at a brokerage like Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. Gives you more investment choices and consolidates your retirement savings. Most brokerages will keep your account open even with a foreign address, but some have restrictions — check before you move.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash it out</strong> — You can withdraw the full amount, but you'll pay income tax plus a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're under 59½. This rarely makes financial sense unless you need the money urgently.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>If you're rolling over to an IRA, do it before you leave the US. Some brokerages make it harder to open new accounts with a foreign address. Fidelity and Schwab are generally more friendly to non-resident account holders.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Tax implications</h2>

    <p>Moving between countries creates a complicated tax year. Some things to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>You'll file US taxes for the year you leave</strong> — This is a partial-year return covering your US income. You may also need to file a state return depending on your state's rules.</li>
      <li><strong>US citizens and green card holders must file US taxes forever</strong> — Even from India. If you're on H1-B and not a citizen/permanent resident, your US filing obligation generally ends when you leave.</li>
      <li><strong>FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Report)</strong> — If you keep US accounts and the combined balance exceeds $10,000 at any point during the year, you must file an FBAR. This applies even after you move to India if you still have US accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>India taxes based on residency</strong> — Once you're a resident, your worldwide income is taxable in India. The US-India tax treaty helps avoid double taxation, but it's complicated.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>The year you move is the most complex for taxes. Strongly consider hiring a cross-border tax professional who understands both US and Indian tax systems. The cost is worth avoiding mistakes that can be expensive to fix later.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Other financial loose ends</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>HSA (Health Savings Account)</strong> — If you have one, you can keep it and use it for qualified medical expenses. The funds don't expire. You just can't contribute after losing your US health insurance.</li>
      <li><strong>Stock options / RSUs</strong> — Check your vesting schedule. Unvested RSUs are typically forfeited when you leave. Vested but unexercised stock options may have a limited exercise window (often 90 days) after your last day.</li>
      <li><strong>Student loans</strong> — These don't go away when you move. Set up autopay from your US account and budget for them in your India finances.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscriptions and recurring charges</strong> — Go through your credit card statements and cancel anything you won't use. Gym memberships, streaming services with US-only content, insurance policies — they add up.</li>
    </ul>
