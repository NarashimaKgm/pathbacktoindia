    <h1>Travel Planning</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>The flight to India is more than just a booking — it's the logistics of moving your life across continents in a few checked bags and carry-ons. A little planning here saves you money, stress, and awkward moments at the check-in counter.</p>

    <h2 id="booking">Booking your flight</h2>

    <h3>Use your rewards</h3>

    <p>If you have credit card reward points or airline miles sitting in accounts you're about to close, now is the time to use them. Pool points from multiple cards if your rewards program allows it, and convert them to airline miles to offset some or all of the ticket cost. There's no point letting points expire or get forfeited when you close the card.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Check if your credit card points can be transferred to airline loyalty programs (Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, etc.). Transferring points to the right airline partner often gives you better value per point than booking through the credit card's own travel portal.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Flexibility matters</h3>

    <p>If your departure date isn't fully locked in — maybe you're waiting on your last day at work, lease end date, or shipping pickup — book a reschedulable ticket. The small premium for a flexible fare is worth it compared to paying change fees or rebooking at a higher price later. Many airlines offer free date changes on certain fare classes.</p>

    <h2 id="extra-bags">Extra checked bags</h2>

    <p>You'll likely be traveling with more luggage than a normal trip. Here's how to handle it:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pre-pay for extra bags online</strong> — Most airlines charge significantly more for additional checked bags if you pay at the airport counter. Book your extra bags through the airline's website or app in advance to get the lower rate.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay well within weight limits</strong> — Don't push bags to exactly 23 kg. Leave a margin of 1-2 kg per bag. Scales at the airport may read differently from yours at home, and overweight fees are steep — often $50-100 per bag for even a small overage.</li>
      <li><strong>Know your airline's bag limits</strong> — Most airlines cap the total number of checked bags at 4 per person, but this varies by airline and ticket class. Confirm the limit and pricing before you pack.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Have a friend or family member drive you to the airport and ask them to stay until all your bags are checked in. If a bag is overweight and you need to pull something out, you can hand it to them. Trying to rearrange or discard items at the check-in counter with 4 heavy bags and a line behind you is not a situation you want to be in.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="stopovers">Stopovers</h2>

    <p>If you're not in a rush, consider booking a flight with a multi-day stopover in another country on the way to India. It's a chance to explore a new city — Dubai, Istanbul, London, Singapore, Tokyo — and break up what would otherwise be a grueling 20+ hour journey. Some airlines (Emirates, Turkish Airlines, Singapore Airlines) actively promote stopover programs with discounted hotels.</p>

    <p>A few things to plan for if you're doing a stopover:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Luggage handling</strong> — If your stopover is long (overnight or multi-day), you may need to collect your checked bags and re-check them for the next leg. Wrangling 4 large bags through immigration, customs, a hotel, and back to the airport is doable but exhausting. Plan for it — arrange a taxi or shuttle that can handle the volume, and check if your hotel offers luggage storage.</li>
      <li><strong>Airport luggage storage</strong> — Most major airports have luggage storage facilities if you want to explore the city without dragging everything along. But with 4 checked bags, storage fees add up and the logistics of dropping off and picking up that many bags can be cumbersome.</li>
      <li><strong>Transit visas</strong> — Some countries require a transit or tourist visa even for a short stopover. Check visa requirements for your passport well in advance. Indian passport holders may need visas for stopovers in the UK, US transit points, or Schengen countries.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>If the stopover logistics with heavy luggage feel too complicated, you can still get a break by choosing a longer layover (6-8 hours) without leaving the airport. Many hub airports have lounges, showers, restaurants, and rest areas. Use your credit card lounge access while you still have it.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="at-the-airport">At the airport</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arrive early</strong> — With multiple checked bags, the check-in process takes longer. Give yourself extra time. Aim for at least 3 hours before an international departure.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep essentials in your carry-on</strong> — Passport, wallet, phone, chargers, medications, a change of clothes, and any documents you'll need on arrival (rental agreement, job offer letter, etc.). If your checked bags are delayed, you should be able to function for a few days.</li>
      <li><strong>Carry valuables on your person</strong> — Jewelry, electronics, important paperwork, and anything irreplaceable should never go in checked luggage.</li>
    </ul>
