    <h1>Shipping & Logistics</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>Getting your belongings from the US to India is one of the more stressful parts of the move. You have two main options: ship items via a relocation service, or carry them as extra checked luggage on your flight. Most people end up doing a combination of both - shipping bulkier items and carrying valuables and essentials with them.</p>

    <h2 id="relocation-services">Relocation services (sea freight)</h2>

    <p>Companies like Universal Relocations and similar services specialize in shipping household goods from the US to India. They handle packing, customs paperwork, and delivery to your door in India. Here's how it typically works:</p>

    <h3>Full-service (door-to-door)</h3>

    <p>The most hands-off option. The relocation company sends a crew to your US home, packs everything for you, picks it up, ships it by sea to India, handles customs clearance, and delivers it to your Indian address by truck. This is the most expensive option but saves you significant effort, especially if you have a lot to ship.</p>

    <h3>Warehouse drop-off or courier-to-warehouse</h3>

    <p>If you have a limited number of items that can fit into large boxes (Lowe's or Home Depot large moving boxes work well), many relocation services offer a cheaper alternative:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Courier to warehouse</strong> - The service provides you with FedEx, UPS, or similar shipping labels. You pack your boxes, attach the labels, and ship them to one of their US warehouses. They consolidate your boxes into a container with other shipments and send it to India by sea. From there, they handle customs and deliver to your Indian address.</li>
      <li><strong>Self drop-off</strong> - If you can drive to the nearest warehouse yourself, you may get better prices since you're cutting out the domestic courier cost. Ask the service if they have a warehouse near you and what the price difference is.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Get quotes from multiple relocation services. Prices can vary significantly depending on volume, weight, origin city, and destination city in India. Ask specifically about per-box rates if you're shipping just a few boxes - some services have minimum shipment requirements.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="transfer-of-residence">Transfer of Residence (TR) facility</h2>

    <p>Indian customs offers a "Transfer of Residence" facility for Indians returning after a stay abroad. Under this provision, you can bring a reasonable quantity of used personal and household goods into India without paying customs duty, or at a reduced duty rate.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Used personal effects</strong> - Clothing, books, kitchen items, bedding, and other used household goods are generally cleared without duty as long as they're in reasonable quantities for personal use.</li>
      <li><strong>Electronics</strong> - Items like laptops, TVs, gaming consoles, and kitchen appliances may require customs clearance with your passport. The relocation service will typically coordinate this - they'll ask you to visit the customs office or provide your passport details for clearance.</li>
      <li><strong>New or high-value items</strong> - Brand-new items, especially electronics still in original packaging, are more likely to attract duty.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>The Transfer of Residence benefit is available to Indian citizens (or persons of Indian origin) who have stayed abroad for a minimum period (typically 2 years in the preceding 5 years, but rules can vary). Your relocation service will be familiar with the current rules and documentation required. Keep your passport, visa copies, and proof of stay abroad handy.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="timeline">Timeline and what to expect</h2>

    <p>Sea freight from the US to India is slow. Door-to-door, including packing, transit, customs clearance, and final delivery, the process can take 4 to 6 months. Sometimes longer.</p>

    <p>This means everything you put in those boxes should be something you can comfortably live without for half a year. Don't ship things you'll need immediately after landing - daily essentials, important documents, medications, work equipment, or clothes for the first few months should travel with you.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Plan your shipping timeline carefully. If you ship too late, you could be waiting months after you've settled in India. If you ship too early, you might need items that are already on a boat. Many people initiate the shipping process 2-4 weeks before their departure date.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="insurance">Insurance</h2>

    <p>Most relocation services include basic insurance coverage with the shipment, but the default coverage is usually minimal - often just a fraction of the actual value of your goods. If a box is lost or damaged, the payout may not come close to covering the replacement cost.</p>

    <p>That said, these services have traditionally been reasonably reliable, and major losses are uncommon. If you're shipping only a few boxes, excess insurance may not even be available as an option. For larger shipments, ask about additional coverage and weigh the cost against the value of what you're shipping. For your most valuable or irreplaceable items, carry them with you instead.</p>

    <h2 id="checked-luggage">Checked luggage</h2>

    <p>For things you need immediately or can't risk losing in transit, extra checked bags on your flight are the way to go.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Most airlines allow up to 4 checked bags per person</strong> - though this varies by airline and ticket class. Check your airline's excess baggage policy and rates. Booking extra bags in advance is usually cheaper than paying at the airport.</li>
      <li><strong>Weight limits</strong> - Typically 23 kg (50 lbs) per bag for economy, 32 kg (70 lbs) for business class. Overweight fees add up fast.</li>
      <li><strong>What to carry in luggage</strong> - Valuables (jewelry, electronics, important documents), medications, clothes for the first few months, items with sentimental value you can't risk losing, and anything you'll need right away.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>If you're traveling as a family, the bag count adds up quickly. Two adults and a child could mean 8-12 checked bags - that's a significant amount of stuff. Coordinate what goes in luggage vs what gets shipped so you're not duplicating or leaving gaps.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>Some premium credit cards offer baggage insurance that covers loss, damage, or delay of checked luggage - separate from the airline's own compensation. Check if the card you're using to book your flight includes this benefit. It can provide additional peace of mind beyond the airline's standard liability limits.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="ship-vs-sell">What to ship vs what to sell or donate</h2>

    <p>Before packing anything, ask yourself: is it cheaper to ship this or to buy it new in India? For bulky items like furniture, mattresses, or large appliances (which run on different voltages anyway), selling or donating in the US usually makes more sense than shipping.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Worth shipping</strong> - Sentimental items, high-quality kitchen tools, specialty items not easily available in India, children's favorite toys and books, professional equipment.</li>
      <li><strong>Probably not worth shipping</strong> - Furniture (heavy, expensive to ship, may not fit Indian homes), large appliances (voltage/plug differences), cheap items that are easily replaceable in India.</li>
      <li><strong>Definitely carry with you</strong> - Important documents, jewelry, electronics you use daily, medications, a few weeks' worth of clothes.</li>
    </ul>
