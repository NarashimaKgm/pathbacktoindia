    <h1>US Mobile Number</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>Your US phone number is tied to more than just phone calls. Bank accounts, brokerage accounts, email services, social media, and countless other platforms use it for two-factor authentication (2FA) via SMS. Losing access to your US number after moving to India can lock you out of critical accounts at the worst possible time. Plan for this before you leave.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Do not cancel your US number without first auditing every account that uses it for 2FA or account recovery. Once the number is released, your carrier can reassign it to someone else - and that person will receive your verification codes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="why-keep">Why you should keep your US number</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>2FA and account recovery</strong> - Banks (Chase, BoA, Schwab), brokerages (Fidelity, Vanguard), email (Gmail, Outlook), and services like Amazon, PayPal, and Venmo send SMS verification codes to your US number. Many of these do not support international numbers for 2FA.</li>
      <li><strong>US bank and credit card calls</strong> - When you call your US bank from India, having a US number on file means they can verify you and call you back. Some banks flag calls from international numbers.</li>
      <li><strong>Receiving calls from US contacts</strong> - Friends, family, former employers, government agencies, and businesses may need to reach you on your US number.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="options">Options for keeping your US number</h2>

    <h3>Port to a low-cost carrier</h3>

    <p>The most popular approach. Port your existing number to a cheap plan before you leave:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Fi</strong> - Works internationally in 200+ countries with no extra charge for data (though speeds may be throttled). Starts at $20/month for the Flexible plan. You can receive calls and texts over Wi-Fi from India. One of the most recommended options for people moving abroad.</li>
      <li><strong>T-Mobile</strong> - Some plans include international texting and data (2G speeds) at no extra cost. Calls are $0.25/min. Check if your current plan already covers this.</li>
      <li><strong>Ultra Mobile, Tello</strong> - Budget options with plans starting around $10-15/month. They work in India on roaming but can be expensive for data. Best if you only need the number for occasional SMS 2FA and won't use it for calls or data in India.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Make sure both your plan and your phone support Wi-Fi calling. With Wi-Fi calling enabled, your US number routes calls over your home internet connection in India instead of using international roaming - this saves a significant amount of money on calls back to the US. You will inevitably need to call US customer service lines from India - to close a credit card you forgot about, dispute a charge, or sort out a bank issue - and these calls often mean sitting on hold for 15-30 minutes. Without Wi-Fi calling, that hold time racks up international roaming charges. Check your carrier's website for Wi-Fi calling compatibility and enable it in your phone settings before you leave.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>Carriers like Ultra Mobile, Tello, T-Mobile, and Google Fi are known to work in India, but international roaming and Wi-Fi calling performance can vary by location. Do your due diligence - check whether your chosen carrier's roaming or Wi-Fi calling works reliably in the specific town or city you're moving to. If you're doing a trial run to India before the move, get a test SIM in advance and verify that it works in your area before committing.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Port to a VoIP / digital number service</h3>

    <p>If you don't need cellular service and only need to receive texts and calls over the internet:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Voice</strong> - Free if you already have it set up. Receives calls and texts over the internet. However, some banks and services do not accept Google Voice numbers for SMS 2FA because they can detect it as a VoIP number.</li>
      <li><strong>NumberBarn</strong> - Parks your US number for as low as $2/month (forward-only, no texting). For $6/month you get call forwarding and texting. Useful if you just want to keep the number alive without a full phone plan.</li>
      <li><strong>OpenPhone, Telos, TextNow</strong> - Various VoIP options with different pricing. Test whether your critical accounts accept verification codes sent to these numbers before committing.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Some banks and financial institutions reject SMS codes sent to VoIP numbers. Before porting your number to a VoIP service, test it with your most critical accounts (bank, brokerage, email). If they don't work, stick with a real carrier like Google Fi.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="audit-2fa">Before you leave: audit and update 2FA</h2>

    <p>Regardless of what you do with your number, take these steps before you leave the US:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>List every account using SMS 2FA</strong> - Banks, brokerages, email, social media, cloud storage, crypto exchanges, utilities, insurance portals. Go through your password manager if you have one.</li>
      <li><strong>Switch to app-based 2FA where possible</strong> - Authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator) work without a phone number. Move as many accounts as you can away from SMS-based 2FA.</li>
      <li><strong>Save backup codes</strong> - Most services that offer 2FA also provide one-time backup codes. Download and store these securely (password manager or printed copy in a safe place). These are your lifeline if you lose access to your phone.</li>
      <li><strong>Update recovery phone numbers</strong> - For accounts that allow a secondary recovery number, add your Indian number (once you have one) as a backup alongside your US number.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>If you use a physical SIM for your US number and plan to use an Indian SIM as well, make sure your phone supports dual SIM or eSIM. Most modern phones do. You can keep the US number on eSIM and use the physical slot for your Indian SIM, or vice versa.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="letting-go">Eventually letting go of the US number</h2>

    <p>The US number is not meant to be kept on international roaming forever. It's a transitional tool. Once you've settled in India and completed the following, you can consider releasing it or downgrading to a minimal plan that just parks the number without active service:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Converted all US financial accounts (banks, brokerages, credit cards) to non-resident status or updated them with your Indian contact details.</li>
      <li>Closed any US accounts you no longer need.</li>
      <li>Switched all critical 2FA from SMS to app-based authenticators or backup codes.</li>
      <li>Shared your Indian number with US friends, family, and contacts who may need to reach you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At that point, a service like NumberBarn ($2-6/month) can keep the number reserved in your name without active cellular service - so it doesn't get reassigned to someone else. This is much cheaper than maintaining a full carrier plan indefinitely.</p>
