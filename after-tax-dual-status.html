    <p>The year you leave the United States is unlike any other tax year. Most Indians who have lived and worked in the US for several years will be treated as <strong>full-year US tax residents</strong> in the year they leave — meaning the entire year's worldwide income, including everything earned in India after departure, goes on their US return. However, you may have an option to instead file as a <strong>dual status alien</strong>, splitting the year into a resident portion and a nonresident portion. Understanding which situation applies to you, and whether the alternative is worth pursuing, can make a significant difference to your tax bill.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Work with a professional — this is not DIY territory</p>
      <p>The decisions described on this page can involve irrevocable elections, complex interactions with tax treaties, and significant dollar consequences. <strong>Strongly consider working with a CPA or enrolled agent who specializes in US nonresident and expatriate taxation before filing or making any decision.</strong> A general-practice tax preparer who handles routine Form 1040s may not be equipped to navigate these rules correctly.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Case 1: Full-Year Resident — The Default for Most Returning Indians</h2>

    <p>US tax residency for non-citizens is determined by the <strong>Substantial Presence Test (SPT)</strong>. The formula counts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All days physically present in the US in the <em>current</em> year, plus</li>
      <li>One-third of days present in the <em>prior</em> year, plus</li>
      <li>One-sixth of days present in the year <em>before that</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If this total is <strong>183 or more</strong>, and you were present for at least 31 days in the current year, you are a US tax resident for the full year — automatically, with no election required.</p>

    <p>For most Indians returning home after several years of working in the US, this threshold is easily met. If you were in the US from January through, say, June or July, you likely had well over 183 days in the current year alone, without even factoring in prior years. The SPT result is the same whether you left in March or December — <strong>you are a full-year resident for US tax purposes</strong>.</p>

    <h3>What full-year resident filing means</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>You file a standard <strong>Form 1040</strong> — exactly like any other year</li>
      <li>You can <strong>e-file</strong> normally</li>
      <li>You can claim the <strong>standard deduction</strong> (Single: $14,600 / MFJ: $29,200 for 2024)</li>
      <li>You report <strong>worldwide income for the entire year</strong> — including salary, investments, and any other income earned in India after your departure date</li>
      <li>India taxes paid on that post-departure India income can often be offset via the <strong>Foreign Tax Credit (Form 1116)</strong>, reducing or eliminating double taxation</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">The Foreign Tax Credit is your friend here</p>
      <p>If India taxes your post-departure income and the US also taxes it (because you're a full-year resident), you generally get to claim a credit on your US return for the Indian taxes paid. This avoids true double taxation in most situations, though the mechanics can be complex. Keep all Indian tax documents and consult a professional on how to apply the credit correctly.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Case 2: Opting for Dual Status Filing Instead</h2>

    <p>Even if the Substantial Presence Test makes you a full-year resident by default, you may be able to <strong>choose</strong> to be treated as a dual status alien instead — splitting the tax year at your departure date:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resident period</strong> (January 1 → departure date): worldwide income taxed as a US resident</li>
      <li><strong>Nonresident period</strong> (departure date + 1 → December 31): only US-sourced income is taxed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The key benefit: income you earn <em>in India</em> after your departure — salary from an Indian employer, Indian bank interest, Indian dividends, Indian capital gains — is <strong>entirely excluded</strong> from US taxation during the nonresident period. You don't need a Foreign Tax Credit to shield it; it simply isn't taxable in the US at all.</p>

    <h3>When dual status filing might make sense</h3>

    <p>Dual status is worth exploring if you have <strong>substantial India-sourced income in the months after departure</strong> — for example, if you joined a high-paying job in India, received a large bonus, sold Indian property, or had significant Indian investment income in the second half of the year. In those cases, the income excluded from the nonresident period can be large enough to outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

    <h3>The significant drawbacks of dual status filing</h3>

    <p>Dual status filing is not free. The IRS imposes real restrictions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>No standard deduction.</strong> Under IRC §63(c)(6)(B), dual status filers cannot claim the standard deduction at all. You must itemize (mortgage interest, state taxes, charitable contributions, etc.) or take no deduction. For 2024, this means losing $14,600 (single) or $29,200 (MFJ) off the bat.</li>
      <li><strong>Paper filing only.</strong> Dual status returns cannot be e-filed. The return must be mailed on paper to the IRS — typically the Austin, TX international filers address. Processing takes months.</li>
      <li><strong>More restricted filing status.</strong> Certain credits (Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Credit) and deductions are reduced or unavailable on dual status returns.</li>
      <li><strong>Greater complexity.</strong> You file Form 1040 as the primary return (labeled "Dual Status Return") with Form 1040-NR attached as a statement (labeled "Dual Status Statement"). Most standard tax software cannot handle this correctly.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Losing the standard deduction can be painful</p>
      <p>Many filers do not realize the standard deduction is completely unavailable on a dual status return. If your itemized deductions are modest, losing $14,600 or more translates directly to thousands of dollars in additional tax. Do the math — or have a professional do it — before choosing dual status over full-year resident status.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How residency is actually terminated mid-year</h3>

    <p>To file as a dual status alien, you need a legal basis for your US residency to end on your departure date. The main mechanisms are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Closer Connection Exception (Form 8840):</strong> If you had fewer than 183 <em>actual</em> days in the US in the departure year (note: the weighted SPT formula can push you over 183 without you having 183 actual days), and you established a tax home in India and had a closer connection to India, you can file Form 8840 to claim nonresident status for the post-departure period. This terminates SPT-based residency at departure.</li>
      <li><strong>Green Card Abandonment:</strong> If you held a Green Card and formally abandoned it (Form I-407 or judicial determination), US residency ends on that date regardless of the SPT. This is important — your physical departure date and Green Card abandonment date can differ, and the abandonment date controls.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax Treaty Tiebreaker:</strong> The India-US tax treaty (Article 4 on Residence) may allow you to be treated as a resident of India for the post-departure period, effectively overriding SPT for that portion of the year. This requires disclosing the treaty position on Form 8833 with your return.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">SPT actual days vs. weighted days matters</p>
      <p>It is possible to exceed the SPT's 183-day weighted threshold without having been physically present in the US for 183 days in the current year. If your actual days in the departure year were under 183, the Closer Connection Exception may be available to you. If your actual days were 183 or more, the Closer Connection Exception is not available — but a treaty tiebreaker may still be.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Comparing the Two Approaches</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Full-year resident (Case 1):</strong> All worldwide income taxed for the full year. Standard deduction available. E-filing allowed. Foreign Tax Credit offsets India taxes on post-departure India income. Simpler to file.</li>
      <li><strong>Dual status (Case 2):</strong> Post-departure India income excluded entirely from US tax. No standard deduction. Paper filing only. More complex return. May be beneficial if India income in the nonresident period is large enough to justify the trade-offs.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Have a professional model both before deciding</p>
      <p>The right choice depends on your actual numbers: how much India income you had after departure, what your itemized deductions look like, and whether you qualify to terminate residency mid-year. A good expatriate tax professional will prepare a side-by-side comparison of both approaches before you commit to either.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How to File the Dual Status Return</h2>

    <p>If you choose dual status filing, the mechanics are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Prepare <strong>Form 1040</strong> covering the resident period (Jan 1 to departure date). Write "Dual Status Return" across the top. This is your primary return.</li>
      <li>Prepare <strong>Form 1040-NR</strong> covering the nonresident period (departure date + 1 to Dec 31). Write "Dual Status Statement" across the top. This is attached as a supporting statement — not filed separately.</li>
      <li>Attach the 1040-NR behind the 1040 and mail the full package to the IRS address for international filers (verify the current address on IRS.gov — it can change).</li>
      <li>Always send via <strong>USPS certified mail or registered mail</strong> with return receipt. Keep the receipt permanently as proof of timely filing.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Most standard tax software cannot handle this</p>
      <p>TurboTax and H&amp;R Block are not designed for dual status returns. Sprintax (built for nonresident filers) handles Form 1040-NR but may not handle the combined dual status package. Be explicit with any preparer about your situation — insist they have experience with dual status and expatriate returns specifically.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Income Reported in Each Period (Dual Status)</h2>

    <h3>Resident period (Jan 1 → departure date)</h3>
    <p>You report worldwide income exactly as you would in any prior year: US wages, India income, investment income from anywhere, retirement distributions, rental income globally — everything.</p>

    <h3>Nonresident period (departure date + 1 → Dec 31)</h3>
    <p>Only <strong>US-sourced income</strong> is reportable. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wages from a US employer for US-performed services (remote work from India for a US employer may still be US-sourced — this is a nuanced area)</li>
      <li>Dividends from US corporations</li>
      <li>Gains from selling US real property</li>
      <li>Rental income from US property</li>
      <li>US bank interest in certain cases</li>
    </ul>
    <p>India income earned after departure — Indian salary, Indian bank interest, Indian dividends, Indian capital gains — is <strong>not reportable</strong> during the nonresident period.</p>

    <h2>Green Card Holders: Additional Considerations</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The date you <strong>formally abandon your Green Card</strong> (by filing Form I-407 or having a judicial determination) may differ from your physical departure date — and the abandonment date controls when residency ends for tax purposes</li>
      <li>Keep all documentation: passport stamps, I-94 records, flight records, and any Form I-407 filing confirmation</li>
      <li>If you held a Green Card for <strong>eight or more of the last fifteen years</strong> and your net worth exceeds $2 million (or your average annual net income tax liability over the prior five years exceeds a threshold that adjusts annually), you may be subject to the <strong>expatriation tax ("exit tax") under IRC §877A</strong> — a separate and significantly more complex topic. If this might apply to you, speak to a tax professional before abandoning your Green Card.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Credits and Other Limitations on Dual Status Returns</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Child Tax Credit / Earned Income Credit:</strong> Generally not available on dual status returns</li>
      <li><strong>Foreign Tax Credit:</strong> Still claimable for taxes paid to India on income that is taxable in both countries during the resident period, but the calculation is complex</li>
      <li><strong>IRA deductibility:</strong> May be limited depending on which period your earned income falls in</li>
      <li><strong>FBAR (FinCEN 114) and Form 8938:</strong> Foreign financial account and asset reporting obligations may still apply for the departure year based on your account balances — these obligations are separate from your income tax return</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>State Tax Obligations</h2>

    <p>Your federal filing is separate from state tax obligations. States have their own residency rules and part-year filing requirements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Most states require a part-year resident return for the period you lived there, regardless of how you file federally</li>
      <li>Some states (notably California) are aggressive about asserting full-year residency even after physical departure, especially if you maintain ties like property, a spouse, or business interests</li>
      <li>If you had deferred compensation, vesting stock options, or rental income from a state after leaving, you may still owe that state tax as a nonresident</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Dates and Deadlines</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>April 15:</strong> Standard filing deadline and deadline to pay any tax owed</li>
      <li><strong>June 15:</strong> Automatic 2-month extension for taxpayers living outside the US on April 15 — but tax owed is still due April 15 with interest</li>
      <li><strong>October 15:</strong> Extended filing deadline if Form 4868 was filed by April 15</li>
      <li><strong>April 15:</strong> FBAR deadline (FinCEN 114, for foreign financial accounts with aggregate balance exceeding $10,000 at any point in the year)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Most Indians who spent the first half (or more) of the year in the US before departing will be <strong>full-year US tax residents by default</strong> under the Substantial Presence Test — no election needed, file a regular Form 1040</li>
      <li>As a full-year resident, you report worldwide income for the whole year, but the Foreign Tax Credit protects against double taxation on India income</li>
      <li>You may be able to <strong>opt for dual status filing instead</strong> — which excludes post-departure India income entirely — if you can legally terminate residency at your departure date (via Closer Connection, Green Card abandonment, or treaty tiebreaker)</li>
      <li>Dual status filing means <strong>no standard deduction and paper-only filing</strong> — the trade-off is only worth it if the India income excluded is large enough to compensate</li>
      <li>Have a professional model both approaches with your actual numbers before deciding</li>
      <li>Green Card holders held for 8+ years should separately investigate the expatriation tax before abandoning</li>
      <li>State filing obligations are separate and can be complex, especially in California, New York, and New Jersey</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Final caution: get professional help</p>
      <p>The decisions you make in your departure-year return can have lasting consequences and are often difficult or impossible to reverse. Work with a <strong>US-licensed CPA, enrolled agent, or tax attorney who specializes in nonresident and expatriate taxation</strong>. Be specific: tell them you are an Indian national who was a long-term US resident returning to India, and ask explicitly whether they handle dual status and expatriate returns regularly.</p>
