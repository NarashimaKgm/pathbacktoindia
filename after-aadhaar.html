    <h1>Aadhaar Card</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identity number issued by UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India). It is linked to your biometrics — fingerprints and iris scan. You will need it for almost everything in India: opening a bank account, getting a SIM card, filing taxes, receiving government benefits, and more. Getting it sorted early makes every other step easier.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>If you already have an Aadhaar from before you moved to the US, you don't need a new one. But you may need to update your address and phone number. You can do this online at myaadhaar.uidai.gov.in or by visiting an Aadhaar enrollment center.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="documents">Documents you'll need</h2>

    <p>For a fresh Aadhaar enrollment, you need proof of identity and proof of address. Commonly accepted documents:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proof of identity</strong> — Indian passport, PAN card, or voter ID.</li>
      <li><strong>Proof of address</strong> — Passport with current Indian address, utility bill, bank statement, rental agreement, or a letter from a gazetted officer / tehsildar. If you've just arrived and don't have address proof in your name, a landlord's NOC or a relative's address proof along with a letter confirming you live there can work.</li>
      <li><strong>Date of birth proof</strong> — Passport or birth certificate.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Carry originals of all documents. The operator will scan them at the center. Photocopies are not enough on their own.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="enrollment">Enrollment process</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Book an appointment</strong> — Visit uidai.gov.in and book a slot at a nearby Aadhaar enrollment center. Walk-ins are possible but expect long wait times.</li>
      <li><strong>Visit the center</strong> — Bring your original documents. The operator will verify them, take your photograph, scan your fingerprints, and capture an iris scan.</li>
      <li><strong>Collect your acknowledgment slip</strong> — You'll receive an enrollment number. Use this to track the status of your application online.</li>
      <li><strong>Receive your Aadhaar</strong> — The physical card is mailed to your address in 2-4 weeks. You can download the e-Aadhaar (digital copy) from the UIDAI website as soon as it's generated, usually within 2-3 weeks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="common-issues">Common issues</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Address proof difficulties</strong> — If you're staying with family and don't have any utility bills in your name, the head of household can provide their Aadhaar along with a consent letter. Some centers are more flexible than others — if one center rejects your documents, try another.</li>
      <li><strong>Biometric failures</strong> — If your fingerprints don't scan well (common if your hands are dry or worn), the operator may retry a few times. Iris scan is the fallback. Moisturizing your hands before the appointment can help.</li>
      <li><strong>Long processing times</strong> — While the official timeline is 2-3 weeks, delays do happen. Download the e-Aadhaar as soon as it's available — you don't need to wait for the physical card to start using it.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Never share your Aadhaar number or OTP with anyone over the phone. Aadhaar-related fraud is common. UIDAI will never call you asking for your Aadhaar details.</p>
