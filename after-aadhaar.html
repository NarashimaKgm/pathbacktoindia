    <h1>Aadhaar Card</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identity number issued by UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India). It is linked to your biometrics - fingerprints and iris scan. You will need it for almost everything in India: opening a bank account, getting a SIM card, filing taxes, receiving government benefits, and more. Getting it sorted early makes every other step easier.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>If you already have an Aadhaar from before you moved to the US, you don't need a new one. But you may need to update your address and phone number. You can do this online at myaadhaar.uidai.gov.in or by visiting an Aadhaar enrollment center.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Which section is for you?</p>
      <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1.25rem;">
        <li><strong>Have an existing Aadhaar, need to update details</strong> — read on from here.</li>
        <li><strong>Applying for Aadhaar for the first time, under 18 at the time Aadhaar was applied for</strong> — read on from here.</li>
        <li><strong>Applying for Aadhaar for the first time as an adult (18+)</strong> — <a href="#adult-enrollment">skip directly to the 18+ Fresh Enrollment section</a>. The standard process below does not apply to you.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="documents">Documents you'll need</h2>

    <p>For a fresh Aadhaar enrollment, you need proof of identity and proof of address. Commonly accepted documents:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proof of identity</strong> - Indian passport, PAN card, or voter ID.</li>
      <li><strong>Proof of address</strong> - Passport with current Indian address, utility bill, bank statement, or rental agreement. A letter from a tehsildar in the official UIDAI standard certificate format is also accepted. If you've just arrived and don't have any address proof in your name yet, the tehsildar letter in the official UIDAI format is the most reliable option.</li>
      <li><strong>Date of birth proof</strong> - Passport or birth certificate.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Carry originals of all documents. The operator will scan them at the center. Photocopies are not enough on their own.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="enrollment">Enrollment process</h2>

    <p><em>This covers updating an existing Aadhaar or enrolling a child. If you are an adult enrolling for the first time, <a href="#adult-enrollment">see the 18+ section below</a> instead.</em></p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Book an appointment</strong> - Visit uidai.gov.in and book a slot at a nearby Aadhaar enrollment center. Walk-ins are possible but expect long wait times.</li>
      <li><strong>Visit the center</strong> - Bring your original documents. The operator will verify them, take your photograph, scan your fingerprints, and capture an iris scan.</li>
      <li><strong>Collect your acknowledgment slip</strong> - You'll receive an enrollment number. Use this to track the status of your application online.</li>
      <li><strong>Receive your Aadhaar</strong> - The physical card is mailed to your address in 2-4 weeks. You can download the e-Aadhaar (digital copy) from the UIDAI website as soon as it's generated, usually within 2-3 weeks.</li>
    </ol>

<div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Never share your Aadhaar number or OTP with anyone over the phone. Aadhaar-related fraud is common. UIDAI will never call you asking for your Aadhaar details.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="adult-enrollment">18+ Fresh Enrollment (Returning from Abroad)</h2>

    <p>If you are applying for Aadhaar as an adult for the first time - which is common for people who left India before Aadhaar was widespread - the process is significantly more involved than it appears. The standard information online often does not reflect the reality of 18+ enrollment. Read this section carefully before you begin.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Prepare for a long process</p>
      <p>Each rejected application can take 30 or more days before you get a result. The residency requirement adds further delays. End to end, the process can take anywhere from several months to close to a year. Plan accordingly and do not depend on Aadhaar for time-sensitive tasks in the near term.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Where to go</h3>

    <p>Not all Aadhaar centers accept 18+ fresh enrollment. You need to visit an <strong>Aadhaar Seva Kendra</strong> or the Aadhaar center at your <strong>taluk office</strong>. Regular enrollment centers at banks or post offices typically cannot process first-time adult applications.</p>

    <h3>Choosing your documents</h3>

    <p>For proof of identity and proof of address, a <strong>Voter ID or Passport is strongly preferred</strong> because each of these alone covers both requirements, which simplifies the process. If you use separate documents for identity and address, the name must be <em>exactly identical</em> across both - even minor differences in spelling or initials will cause rejection.</p>

    <p>If you are a resident and plan to use your passport as proof:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your <strong>immigration records will be checked</strong> to verify that you have spent at least <strong>182 days in India</strong> before the date of application.</li>
      <li>If this check fails, your application will be rejected. Make sure you have been in India long enough before applying.</li>
      <li>There is a separate <strong>NRI Aadhaar</strong> option where the 182-day residency requirement is waived. If you qualify or prefer that route, ask specifically for it at the center.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>At the enrollment center</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>The operator only submits your application</strong> - they have no authority to approve or reject it. Enrollment is free of charge. Do not pay anyone claiming otherwise.</li>
      <li><strong>Verify every detail carefully</strong> before the operator finalizes the submission. Check name, date of birth, address, and all other fields character by character against your documents. Rejections are processed by an automated system, and the standard resolution is simply to reapply - there is no easy correction path.</li>
      <li><strong>Collect your acknowledgment slip</strong> with your enrollment number. Keep this safe - you will need it for status tracking and for the state government verification step.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>After submission: tracking and timeline</h3>

    <p>The processing timeline for 18+ enrollment is up to <strong>180 days</strong>, and the application passes through many stages. Monitor your status daily on the UIDAI website using your enrollment number.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Applications can be rejected as early as 60 days in, so do not assume no news is good news.</li>
      <li>The application will eventually reach a stage where it is with the <strong>State Government for verification</strong> in your district or sub-division. This is a key milestone to watch for.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>State government verification (Tahsildar office)</h3>

    <p>Once the application reaches the state government verification stage, you need to take action:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Visit your <strong>Tahsildar office</strong> with your enrollment acknowledgment slip and your address proof document.</li>
      <li>The Tahsildar has access to the state government verification portal and can approve your application from there.</li>
      <li><strong>Be proactive.</strong> 18+ adult enrollments are relatively rare, and Tahsildars may not be familiar with the process or have their login credentials readily available. Follow up regularly and do not assume it will happen automatically.</li>
      <li>Once the Tahsildar approves, you will typically receive your e-Aadhaar within about a week.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>If your application is rejected</h3>

    <p>Rejection messages are often vague and not directly actionable. Here is the recommended escalation path:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Start with the <strong>UIDAI grievance cell</strong>.</li>
      <li>If the grievance cell does not give you a clear, actionable response, escalate to <strong>CPGRAMS</strong> (Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System).</li>
      <li>As a last resort, file an <strong>RTI (Right to Information)</strong> request. Many applicants have reported that CPGRAMS and RTI produce more meaningful and actionable responses than the standard grievance channel.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note on advice from others</p>
      <p>Most people who have an Aadhaar card obtained it years ago, before these adult enrollment procedures were put in place. Their experience does not reflect the current process. Take advice on this topic with a grain of salt and rely on official UIDAI sources and recent firsthand accounts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Border state exception</p>
      <p>In some border states, including Assam, the state government has suspended approvals for 18+ Aadhaar enrollment. If you are in one of these states, the path forward is unclear and you may need to seek specific guidance for your situation.</p>
