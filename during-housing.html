    <h1>Temporary Housing</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>The transition period is messy - you might end your US lease before your last working day, need a place to stay when you land in India, or have to work from your India office for the remainder of your notice period. Having your temporary housing sorted in advance removes one major source of stress during an already chaotic time.</p>

    <h2 id="after-lease-ends">After your US lease ends</h2>

    <p>If you've terminated your US lease early but still have work days left, you'll need somewhere to stay. A few options:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stay with friends or colleagues</strong> - The simplest and cheapest option if someone can host you for a few days or weeks.</li>
      <li><strong>Short-term rental</strong> - Airbnb, Furnished Finder, or corporate housing. These can be expensive on short notice, so book early if you know the dates.</li>
      <li><strong>Hotels</strong> - Extended-stay hotels (Residence Inn, Home2 Suites, Extended Stay America) offer weekly rates that are more reasonable than nightly bookings.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Use your expiring hotel points, credit card reward points, and free night certificates to cover temporary stays. If you're closing credit cards with hotel loyalty status or accumulated points, this is the perfect time to burn through them rather than letting them expire.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Working from a different city</h3>

    <p>If your lease has ended and you still have a few weeks of work left, talk to your manager about working from a different location - a friend's place in another city, a family member's home, or even a short trip to a city you've always wanted to visit. Many companies are flexible about remote work during a notice period, especially if you're already transitioning out.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Working from a different US state, even temporarily, can have tax implications. Some states require income tax filing if you work from within their borders for even a short period. Check with your employer's HR or payroll team before relocating temporarily - they may need to register you in that state for tax purposes, or they may not allow it at all.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="land-in-india">When you land in India</h2>

    <p>Have your accommodation figured out before you board the plane. You don't want to be searching for a place to stay after a 20-hour flight with jet lag and 4 checked bags.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Family home</strong> - The most common option. If you're moving back to your hometown, staying with parents or family while you get settled is practical and gives you time to find a permanent place without rushing.</li>
      <li><strong>Serviced apartments</strong> - If you're moving to a city where you don't have family, or need privacy and space, serviced apartments offer furnished units with flexible monthly leases. Available in most major Indian cities through platforms like Stanza Living, Nestaway, or local operators.</li>
      <li><strong>Hotels</strong> - For the first few days or a week while you get your bearings. Use those remaining hotel loyalty points or credit card free night certificates here.</li>
      <li><strong>Company-provided housing</strong> - Some employers offer temporary accommodation for relocating employees. Ask your new employer if this is available - even a few weeks of covered housing helps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>If you're finishing your notice period from India</h3>

    <p>Some companies allow you to work your remaining notice period from the India office or remotely from India. If this is your situation:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Confirm the arrangement in writing</strong> - Get your manager's and HR's approval documented. Make sure it's clear whether you're working as a US employee remotely or transitioning to an India entity.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan for time zone differences</strong> - If you're still on US hours, your days will be inverted. Make sure your temporary housing is comfortable enough to support odd working hours - reliable Wi-Fi, a quiet workspace, and blackout curtains go a long way.</li>
      <li><strong>Sort out your setup</strong> - Ensure you have a reliable internet connection, access to VPN and work tools, and any hardware you need. Don't assume your parents' home Wi-Fi will handle video calls all day.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>Working from India while still employed by a US entity can have tax and compliance implications in both countries. Your employer's HR team should be involved in this arrangement. The specifics depend on whether your company has an India entity, the duration of the arrangement, and the tax treaty between the two countries.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="permanent-housing">Finding permanent housing</h2>

    <p>Don't rush into a long-term rental or purchase immediately after landing. Give yourself at least a few weeks to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Understand the neighborhood and commute to your workplace.</li>
      <li>Get a sense of rental prices and what's reasonable for the area.</li>
      <li>Visit multiple properties in person - photos online don't tell the full story.</li>
      <li>Talk to locals and colleagues about which areas are good for families, safety, amenities, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Rental agreements in India are typically 11 months with a security deposit of 2-3 months' rent. Factor this into your initial cash flow planning.</p>
