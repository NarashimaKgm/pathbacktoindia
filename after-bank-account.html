    <h1>Open Indian Bank Account</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>A resident Indian bank account is essential for receiving salary, paying bills, making UPI payments, and managing daily finances. If you already had NRE/NRO accounts, those will need to be converted. If you're starting fresh, you'll need to open a new account.</p>

    <h2>If you have existing NRE/NRO accounts</h2>

    <p>Once your residential status changes to resident Indian (for tax purposes), you are required to inform your bank and convert your accounts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>NRE account</strong> — Must be converted to a regular resident savings account. The tax-free status on interest ends upon conversion. Any fixed deposits in NRE will continue at the original rate until maturity, after which they convert to regular FDs.</li>
      <li><strong>NRO account</strong> — Can be converted to a regular resident savings account. The process is usually simpler since NRO already had domestic tax treatment.</li>
      <li><strong>FCNR deposits</strong> — Foreign currency deposits will continue until maturity. On maturity, the proceeds are credited to your resident account in INR at the prevailing exchange rate.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Don't delay this conversion. Banks are required to redesignate accounts when your residency status changes. Continuing to operate NRE accounts as a resident can attract penalties and tax complications — the tax-free interest benefit is only for non-residents.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Opening a new account</h2>

    <p>If you don't have an existing Indian bank account, here's what to expect:</p>

    <h3>Documents required</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>PAN card (mandatory for all bank accounts in India)</li>
      <li>Aadhaar card (for KYC and address verification)</li>
      <li>Passport-size photographs</li>
      <li>Proof of address — Aadhaar is usually sufficient. Some banks may ask for a utility bill or rental agreement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Choosing a bank</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Large private banks (HDFC, ICICI, Kotak, Axis)</strong> — Better digital experience, more responsive customer service, good mobile apps. Higher minimum balance requirements (₹10,000–₹25,000 depending on account type and city).</li>
      <li><strong>Public sector banks (SBI, Bank of Baroda, PNB)</strong> — Lower minimum balance requirements, wider branch network in smaller towns. Digital experience is improving but generally behind private banks.</li>
      <li><strong>Digital-first banks (Fi, Jupiter, Niyo)</strong> — Good app experience and usually zero minimum balance. These operate on top of partner banks (e.g., Fi uses Federal Bank). Useful as a secondary account.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Consider opening a salary account if your employer has a tie-up with a specific bank. Salary accounts typically have zero minimum balance requirements and come with perks like free debit cards and higher transaction limits.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Setting up UPI</h2>

    <p>UPI (Unified Payments Interface) is how India pays for nearly everything — from street food to rent. Once your bank account is active:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Download a UPI app — Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, or your bank's own app.</li>
      <li>Register with your Indian mobile number (must be the one linked to your bank account).</li>
      <li>Add your bank account and set a UPI PIN.</li>
      <li>You're ready to send and receive payments instantly.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>UPI requires your mobile number to be linked to your bank account. If you opened the account with a different number or are still using a US number, visit the branch and update your registered mobile number first. UPI will not work without this.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Other things to set up</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Internet banking and mobile banking</strong> — Register at the branch or through the bank's app. You'll need this for fund transfers, bill payments, and managing fixed deposits.</li>
      <li><strong>Debit card</strong> — Most banks issue one with the account. Activate it and set your ATM PIN. Consider a RuPay card for domestic use (lower merchant fees) or a Visa/Mastercard debit if you need international usability.</li>
      <li><strong>Auto-pay mandates</strong> — Set up standing instructions for recurring payments like rent, utilities, insurance premiums, and SIPs (systematic investment plans).</li>
    </ul>
