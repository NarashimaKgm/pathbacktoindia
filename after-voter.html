    <h1>Voter ID</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>The Voter ID card (officially called EPIC — Electors Photo Identity Card) is issued by the Election Commission of India. While it is primarily used for voting in elections, it also serves as a widely accepted proof of identity and address. If you're settling back in India permanently, registering as a voter and getting your Voter ID is an important civic step.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>If you already had a Voter ID from before you moved to the US, your name may still be on the electoral roll at your old address. You'll need to update your address or apply for a fresh registration at your new constituency. You cannot be registered in two constituencies simultaneously.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>You must be an Indian citizen.</li>
      <li>You must be at least 18 years old on the qualifying date (January 1 of the year of revision of the electoral roll).</li>
      <li>You must be a resident of the constituency where you are applying — this is based on your current address in India.</li>
      <li>NRIs can also register as overseas electors, but this is a separate process with different rules. If you've moved back permanently, register as a regular domestic voter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="documents">Documents required</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proof of identity</strong> — Aadhaar card, Indian passport, PAN card, or driving license.</li>
      <li><strong>Proof of address</strong> — Aadhaar, passport with current address, utility bill, bank passbook, or rental agreement.</li>
      <li><strong>Passport-size photograph</strong> — Recent photo with white or light background.</li>
      <li><strong>Proof of age</strong> — Birth certificate, passport, or school leaving certificate (only needed for first-time applicants).</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Having Aadhaar makes this process significantly easier. The Election Commission now supports Aadhaar-linked voter registration, which speeds up verification. If you've already got your Aadhaar sorted, keep it handy.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="application">Application process</h2>

    <p>You can apply online or offline:</p>

    <h3>Online application</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Visit the National Voters' Service Portal (voters.eci.gov.in) or use the Voter Helpline app.</li>
      <li>Fill out <strong>Form 6</strong> — this is the form for new voter registration or for registering at a new address.</li>
      <li>Upload scanned copies of your documents and photograph.</li>
      <li>Submit the form. You'll receive an application reference number to track status.</li>
      <li>A Booth Level Officer (BLO) may visit your address for physical verification. Be available or have a family member present who can confirm your residence.</li>
      <li>Once approved, your name is added to the electoral roll and the Voter ID card is mailed to your address. You can also download the e-EPIC (digital Voter ID) from the portal.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Offline application</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Visit your nearest Electoral Registration Office or the office of the designated officer in your constituency.</li>
      <li>Collect and fill out Form 6.</li>
      <li>Submit it with photocopies of your documents and photographs.</li>
      <li>The BLO verification and approval process is the same as online.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>Processing typically takes 2-4 weeks after submission, but it can vary depending on the time of year. Applications submitted close to an election may be processed faster. The e-EPIC (digital version) is usually available before the physical card arrives.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="common-issues">Common issues</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name still on old constituency roll</strong> — If you were registered at a previous address (before moving to the US or at a different address in India), you need to get your name deleted from the old roll before or while registering at the new address. You can do this by filing Form 7 (for deletion) at the old constituency, or the system may handle it automatically when you register with Form 6 at the new address — but don't rely on this. Check both rolls to be sure.</li>
      <li><strong>BLO verification missed</strong> — If the BLO visits and no one is home, your application may be rejected. Keep your phone number updated in the application so they can call ahead. If you miss the visit, follow up at the ERO office.</li>
      <li><strong>Name or address mismatch</strong> — Ensure your name is spelled consistently across Aadhaar, PAN, and the voter application. Mismatches can cause delays. If there's a discrepancy, correct it at the source (e.g., update Aadhaar) before applying.</li>
      <li><strong>Linking Aadhaar with Voter ID</strong> — The Election Commission has been pushing for Aadhaar-Voter ID linking. This is voluntary for now but may become mandatory. You can link them through the Voter Helpline app or the NVSP portal.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Do not register at an address where you don't actually reside. Voter registration fraud is a criminal offense. The BLO verification step exists specifically to confirm that you live at the address you've provided.</p>
