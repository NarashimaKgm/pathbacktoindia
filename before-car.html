    <h1>Car</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>If you own a car in the US, figuring out what to do with it is one of the bigger logistical tasks before the move. You can't take it with you (shipping a car to India is impractical and expensive), so you need to sell it or transfer ownership. Start this process early — it can take longer than you expect, and you don't want to be stuck dealing with it in your final week.</p>

    <h2 id="selling">Selling your car</h2>

    <h3>Sell to a dealership</h3>

    <p>The fastest and easiest option, though you'll typically get less than a private sale.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trade-in at a dealership</strong> — Walk into any dealer and get an offer. The process can be done in a single visit. They handle the paperwork, title transfer, and registration cancellation.</li>
      <li><strong>CarMax</strong> — Gives you a no-haggle offer that's valid for 7 days. You can get an online estimate first and then bring the car in for a final appraisal. Quick and straightforward.</li>
      <li><strong>Carvana, Vroom</strong> — Online platforms that give you an instant offer. They pick up the car from your location. Convenient if you want to avoid dealer visits entirely.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Get quotes from multiple places before committing. Offers can vary by hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Check Kelley Blue Book (kbb.com) or Edmunds for a rough estimate of your car's market value so you know if you're getting a fair deal.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Sell privately</h3>

    <p>You'll usually get a better price selling directly to a buyer, but it takes more time and effort.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Craigslist</strong> — Still one of the most popular platforms for private car sales. List with clear photos, maintenance history, and a fair asking price. Be prepared for lowball offers and no-shows.</li>
      <li><strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong> — Large audience, easy to list. You can see buyer profiles, which adds a layer of comfort. Good for reaching local buyers.</li>
      <li><strong>Friends, colleagues, community groups</strong> — Word of mouth through your social circle, office, or local Indian community groups. Often the smoothest transactions because there's mutual trust.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>For private sales, only accept cashier's checks from a reputable bank, or use a secure payment method. Personal checks can bounce, and carrying large amounts of cash is risky. Meet in a safe, public location — many police stations have designated spots for online transaction meetups.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Transfer ownership to a friend</h3>

    <p>If you have a friend or family member who could use the car, transferring ownership is an option. This can be a sale at a reduced price or a gift.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sign the title over to them. Both parties need to sign the back of the title certificate.</li>
      <li>File a release of liability with your state's DMV so you're no longer responsible for the vehicle.</li>
      <li>The new owner will need to register the car in their name and get insurance before driving it.</li>
      <li>If it's a gift, some states still require a bill of sale at $0 or a gift affidavit. Check your state's DMV website for the specific process.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>Whether you sell or gift the car, notify your state's DMV of the transaction in a timely manner. More importantly, make sure the buyer completes the title transfer into their name before you leave the US. If the car is still registered in your name, you could be held liable for traffic tickets, tolls, or accidents that happen after the sale. This is much harder to resolve from India.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="insurance">Insurance</h2>

    <p>Don't rush to cancel your auto insurance — think through the timing carefully.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep coverage until your last day in the US</strong> — Your personal auto insurance typically covers you when you drive rental cars too. If you sell your car early but still plan to rent cars before your departure, keeping your insurance active saves you from buying expensive rental insurance each time.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider dropping to liability-only coverage</strong> — Once you've sold your car and are only renting occasionally, you may not need full coverage. Quite a few credit cards (Chase Sapphire, Amex Platinum, Capital One Venture, etc.) already provide collision damage waiver (CDW) coverage for rental cars. If yours does, you only need liability from your personal policy — switch to a liability-only plan to save money. Check with both your insurance provider and credit card company to confirm what's covered before making the call.</li>
      <li><strong>Cancel only after your last rental</strong> — Once you're done driving in the US for good, cancel the policy. Request a prorated refund for any prepaid premium. Make sure to get written confirmation of cancellation.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>If you plan to return to the US someday, ask your insurance provider if they can put your policy on hold or provide a letter showing your claims history. A clean insurance history can help you get better rates if you restart coverage later.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="emotional-side">The emotional side</h2>

    <p>This might catch you off guard. Parting with a car that has been with you for years — through road trips, daily commutes, late-night drives, first days at new jobs — is harder than it sounds. For many people, this is the first moment the reality of leaving the US truly hits. It stops being abstract and becomes very real.</p>

    <p>It's ok to feel that. Take a moment, take a last drive if you want to. It will get better with time.</p>
