    <h1>Visa</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>This section currently covers <strong>H1-B visa holders</strong> only. Guidance for L1, O1, F1/OPT, and green card holders will be added in the future.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Your H1-B status is tied to your employer and has specific rules about what happens when you resign, get laid off, or voluntarily leave the US. Understanding these scenarios helps you plan your exit timeline and avoid surprises.</p>

    <h2>Scenario 1: You resign and leave the US</h2>

    <p>This is the most common case for people planning a move back. Here's what happens:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Your H1-B status ends on your last day of employment.</strong> There is no work authorization after that date.</li>
      <li><strong>60-day grace period</strong> — After employment ends, you get up to 60 days to either leave the US, change status, or find a new employer to transfer your H1-B. This grace period is capped at a max of one per authorized validity period.</li>
      <li><strong>Your employer files a withdrawal</strong> — They are required to notify USCIS that your employment has ended. Some employers do this promptly, others are slow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Before you resign</h3>

    <p>Don't rush to put in your notice. Use the time while you're still employed to your advantage. Talk to your manager early — be transparent about your plans so you can work together on a smooth transition. Leaving on good terms matters more than you think. Your professional network doesn't stop at borders, and you may need references, rehire eligibility, or even a future transfer back.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use your vacation days</strong> — Coordinate with your manager and take that time off. Travel within the US, visit places you've been meaning to see, or spend time with friends. Once you resign and the 60-day clock starts, you won't have the headspace for leisure.</li>
      <li><strong>Start relocation planning while still on payroll</strong> — Research shipping companies, scout housing in India, sort out finances. Doing this before your last day means less panic after. Also take advantage of employee perks while you still have them — corporate discount codes, relocation assistance programs, negotiated rates with moving services, and any benefits that expire when you leave.</li>
      <li><strong>Check if your company allows international work</strong> — Many companies with India offices have policies that let employees work from another country for a set period (typically 2-4 weeks). If yours does, discuss it with your manager — you could fly to India, start settling in, and resign after you've landed. This buys you time and reduces the chaos of doing everything at once.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Time your resignation so that your last working day + 60 days gives you enough buffer to wrap up everything — closing accounts, shipping belongings, final travel. Don't cut it too close. Give your team adequate notice and help with knowledge transfer — it goes a long way in preserving relationships.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Scenario 2: You get laid off</h2>

    <p>A layoff triggers the same 60-day grace period, but the timeline is usually less in your control.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>The 60-day clock starts on your last day of employment</strong>, not the day you're notified. Check your termination letter for the exact date.</li>
      <li><strong>Severance doesn't extend your status</strong> — Even if you're being paid severance for 3 months, your H1-B status ended on your last working day.</li>
      <li><strong>You can still transfer</strong> — If another employer files an H1-B transfer petition within the 60 days, you can stay. But this is a race against the clock.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>If you're laid off and already considering moving back, don't waste the 60-day grace period hoping for a new job. Use that time to execute your exit plan — close accounts, ship things, and book your travel.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Need more than 60 days? Change of status to B2</h2>

    <p>Whether you resigned or got laid off, the 60-day grace period applies the same way. If your relocation plan needs more time, you can file a <strong>Change of Status (COS) to B1/B2</strong> (tourist visa) before the grace period expires. This lets you stay in the US legally while you wrap up your move.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>File before the 60 days are up</strong> — Submit Form I-539 to USCIS requesting a change to B2 status. Once filed, you're generally in a "period of authorized stay" while the application is pending.</li>
      <li><strong>You cannot work on B2</strong> — This is strictly for wrapping up personal affairs, selling a car, closing accounts, shipping belongings, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>B2 is typically granted for up to 6 months</strong> — More than enough time to handle a complex relocation.</li>
      <li><strong>You can switch back to H1-B from B2</strong> — If during this time you find a new employer willing to sponsor you, they can file an H1-B petition with a change of status request. This is a legitimate path if you change your mind about moving back.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>The B2 change of status has processing times that vary widely. Filing doesn't guarantee approval, and working while on B2 (even remotely for a US employer) is a violation. Consult an immigration attorney if you're considering this route.</p>
