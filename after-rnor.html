    <h1>RNOR Status</h1>
    <p class="article__meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>RNOR stands for <strong>Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident</strong>. This is often a transition status for Indians moving back from abroad. You are tax resident in India, but not yet treated as fully resident for all foreign income and reporting rules.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--note">
      <p class="callout__title">Note</p>
      <p>RNOR is determined separately for each financial year based on your stay pattern and past residency. Many returning Indians get RNOR for a limited period (often 1-3 years), but the exact period depends on your travel history.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="what-is-rnor">What RNOR means</h2>

    <p>Under Indian tax law, RNOR is available when you become resident but still meet at least one of the additional conditions around your prior non-resident years or days of stay in India.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You are first tested for resident/non-resident for the year.</li>
      <li>If you are resident, a second test decides whether you are RNOR or ordinary resident.</li>
      <li>This status can materially change what part of your foreign income is taxed in India.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="tax-position">Tax position and scope</h2>

    <p>As RNOR, your Indian tax base is generally narrower than that of an ordinary resident.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Taxed in India:</strong> Income received in India, accrued in India, or arising from a business controlled/profession set up in India.</li>
      <li><strong>Usually not taxed in India:</strong> Most foreign income earned and received outside India (for example foreign salary, foreign bank interest, or foreign rental income), unless linked to a business controlled from India.</li>
      <li><strong>Reporting relief:</strong> RNOR individuals are generally outside the full foreign asset disclosure that applies to ordinary residents, subject to the ITR form and applicable year rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
      <p>RNOR does not mean "no tax." Indian-source income is still fully taxable, and treaty/foreign tax credit positions can still get complex. File returns carefully each year.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="flexibilities">Flexibilities during RNOR</h2>

    <p>RNOR is useful because it gives you time to reorganize finances after relocation instead of making rushed decisions immediately after moving.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You can continue holding eligible foreign bank and investment assets acquired while non-resident, subject to FEMA rules.</li>
      <li>You can plan remittances and transfers to India in a staged way rather than liquidating everything at once.</li>
      <li>You may use Resident Foreign Currency (RFC) account options offered by banks for returning residents, which can help park foreign currency balances.</li>
      <li>You can use the RNOR period to align ownership structures, nominee details, and tax documentation before becoming ordinary resident.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="what-you-can-do">What you can do in this window</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Keep compliant account status:</strong> Inform banks about your return and redesignate NRE/NRO relationships as required.</li>
      <li><strong>Retain valid foreign holdings:</strong> Continue holding overseas brokerage, retirement, and deposit accounts where permitted, while planning eventual long-term structure.</li>
      <li><strong>Receive and use foreign income:</strong> Continue receiving eligible foreign income streams and decide timing of remittances to India based on your cash-flow and tax plan.</li>
      <li><strong>Structure cash buffers:</strong> Keep part of savings in foreign currency (for education/travel/global obligations) and part in INR for local spending.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare for the next phase:</strong> Build a year-wise plan for the point when you become ordinary resident and global income/disclosures become broader.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="action-checklist">Practical checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Track your India stay days for each financial year in a spreadsheet.</li>
      <li>Ask your CA to confirm your status as NR/RNOR/ROR every year before filing.</li>
      <li>Keep records of foreign income, taxes paid abroad, and account statements.</li>
      <li>Review FEMA compliance for foreign assets and account types annually.</li>
      <li>Do a transition review 6-9 months before likely move to ordinary resident status.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <p class="callout__title">Tip</p>
      <p>Use RNOR years as a planning runway. The best outcome is not just lower tax in one year, but a clean and compliant long-term structure once you become ordinary resident.</p>
